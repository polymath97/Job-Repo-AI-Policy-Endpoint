Since the 1960s successive Australian Governments have joined with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to work towards reconciliation. In July each year, NAIDOC Week celebrations mark the history, culture and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. In 2008, the Australian Parliament passed a motion of Apology to Indigenous Australians for past mistreatment and injustices. \\n Sydney Opera House, New South Wales\\nImage courtesy of Holger LinkWHO  WE ARE\\nAUSTRALIANS\\n56Australia stretches across an incredible 4,000 kilometres (2,485 miles), which is roughly the same distance as New Y ork  to Los Angeles.\\n Royal Botanic Gardens, Victoria\\nImage courtesy of Tourism Australia7From 1788, Britain established a penal colony in Australia. Free settlers followed in increasing numbers, gradually outnumbering convicts, with a colony made up entirely of free settlers established in South Australia in the 1830s. In the 1850s gold was discovered and the gold rush that followed brought people to Australia from all over the world. In 1901, Australia became a nation, forming the Commonwealth of Australia. One year later, Australia became one of the first countries in the world to give women the right to vote.In 1945, Australia became a founding member of the United Nations. We take our international responsibilities seriously and work closely with other countries to promote peace and security. Since 1947, over 65,000 Australians have served in more than 50 peace and security operations around\\xa0the\\xa0world.\\n4\\nOver 30 per cent of the Australian resident population were born overseas, and around 45%\\xa0of Australians have at least one parent who was born overseas.\\n5 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians are now joined by people from nearly 200 countries, making Australia home to over 25\\xa0million people from a variety of cultural, ethnic, linguistic and religious backgrounds.\\n6 OF THE  AUSTRALIAN RESIDENT POPULA TION  WERE BORN OVERSEAS 30%\\nAND AROUND 45%\\xa0OF AUSTRALIANS HAVE AT  LEAST ONE PARENT WHO  WAS BORN OVERSEAS.OVER\\nImage courtesy of Tourism AustraliaAustralians enjoy some of the highest living standards in the world, and despite being home to only 0.3 per cent of the global population, Australia was the world’s 14th largest economy in 2019.\\n7 Tourism is one of Australia’s largest export industries, with international visitors to Australia spending $44.6 billion in 2018–19. The tourism industry directly employs over 666,000 people.8 Australia entered the COVID-19 crisis from a position of strength. Up to the onset of the crisis, the Australian economy remained strong and diverse, recording 28 consecutive years of annual economic growth.\\n9\\nIN 2018–19 INTERNA TIONAL VISITORS TO AUSTRALIA SPENT\\n$44.6 BILLION  Uluru, Northern TerritorySTRONG  AND OPEN ECONOMY\\n89\\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued\\xa0to assist countries in the Indo-Pacific to access safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. \\nOur regional vaccine program will ensure that Pacific countries achieve full COVID-19 vaccine\\xa0coverage. \\nThe Indo-Pacific region is vital to Australia’s security and prosperity. The region encompasses Australia’s Pacific family, our close neighbours, our United States ally, and our other major strategic and trading partners. Placing the Pacific at the centre of Australia’s foreign policy, the Pacific Step-up is lifting Australia’s engagement in, and partnership with, our region to help grow economies, build resilience and enhance regional stability.

Today, \\nthe country faces new challenges as population growth, \\nurbanisation, and technology disruptions create the need \\nfor a step-change in infrastructure prioritisation, design, \\nand\\xa0productivity. \\nFounded on three decades of innovation around the financing and delivery of major public \\ninfrastructure, Australia is among the most advanced economies globally in terms of \\neffective collaboration between the public and private sectors to deliver transport, energy, \\nand social infrastructure. It has also become a leader in private infrastructure investment as \\nmanaged funds seek opportunities in this sector, fuelled by the introduction of compulsory \\nsuperannuation arrangements. Infrastructure makes a major contribution to the Australian \\neconomy in terms of jobs, growth, and exports—the country spent some A$1,177 (US$9061) \\nper capita on transport infrastructure in 2017, ranking second among OECD countries.\\nNevertheless, challenges will intensify in the future—especially around the country’s ability \\nto meet infrastructure demand. Australia’s population is projected to grow to 40.6\\xa0million \\nin 2050,2 driven by growth in the country’s two major cities: Sydney and Melbourne are \\nexpanding annually at 1.8 percent and 2.5 percent respectively.3 This rapid population \\nincrease means Australia faces a substantial infrastructure gap: the McKinsey Global Institute \\n(MGI) estimates the shortfall between current infrastructure investment levels and needs \\n(2017–35) to be 1 percent of GDP.4 To try to meet the demands of this rapid population growth \\nin its urban centres, Australia is investing in transport, utilities, and social infrastructure at an \\nunprecedented scale (Exhibit 1)—aggregate investment in projects greater than A$50 million \\nhas climbed from A$26 billion in 2016 to an estimated A$77 billion in 2020.\\nToday, however, additional challenges are adding further complexity to the historical issues \\nof delivering major projects on budget, an expanding infrastructure funding gap, and the \\nsheer scale, pace, and inherent complexity of the infrastructure program. These include \\ntechnology-led disruptions around the future of mobility, a clear need to reassess traditional \\ncommercial models, stagnating productivity, expected skill shortages, and the impact of \\nmajor concurrent projects on city residents and communities. In the face of such emerging \\ndisruptions, one thing is clear: the strengths that have propelled Australia to a leadership \\nposition in infrastructure planning, design, and delivery will not be sufficient to underpin \\nfuture success.\\n1 2017 average AUD to USD conversion.\\n2 Population Projections, Australia, 2017 (base)—2066, Australian Bureau of Statistics,  abs.gov.au.\\n3 ABC news.com, March 29 2019, https://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/australian-economy/sydney-is-\\nshedding-established-residents-while-darwin-is-shedding-people-full-stop/news-story/4935683a798f5a5216b0\\n23fd8e610dc2; and Australia Bureau of Statistics on population growth, https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/\\nlatestProducts/3218.0Media%20Release12017-18.\\n4 Bridging Infrastructure Gaps, Has the World Made Progress?, McKinsey Global Institute,  October 2017, McKinsey.com.Executive summary3\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperativeThere is an urgent imperative for infrastructure players in Australia to innovate across \\nsix\\xa0dimensions:  \\n1. Future proof new assets/investments. Technology, digital, and data analytics are \\ndisrupting urban mobility, leading to uncertainty around future investments and opening up \\nnew possibilities for the way in which infrastructure assets are constructed and operated. \\nNew trends  such as the uptake of electric and autonomous vehicles (implying increased \\nroad capacity, vehicle charging infrastructure, and curb modifications), smart-city \\ntechnology, the future of work (which will affect travel patterns) and increased regulation \\nand awareness of climate impact require infrastructure stakeholders to conceive an \\nintegrated vision of future mobility requirements for people and freight.  This includes \\ndeveloping scenarios around the impact on transport infrastructure demand; translating \\nthese scenarios into future-proofed strategic prioritisation of capital and resources at a \\nportfolio and project level (for example, by developing a point of view on the optimal share \\nof investment between road and rail); identifying and developing new competencies and \\nprocesses to achieve this future state; and creating a roadmap of initiatives and enabling \\nactions (for example, changes to planning, creation of a “Future Mobility Hub”, and setting \\nclear technology standards and safety requirements) to deliver the vision.  \\n2. Rethink project selection and prioritisation. The current processes by which projects \\nare developed and assessed do not facilitate rapid needs-based prioritisation. Meeting \\nfuture infrastructure needs will also mean being more “shovel-ready” by going to market \\nwith the right projects quicker. There are limitations to currently used metrics such as \\nthe benefit-cost ratio and net present value, and decisions can also suffer from inherent \\ncognitive biases. Streamlining the business-case process can enable political decisions \\nto be based on the best possible supporting evidence while providing timely analysis. \\nStakeholders can consider addressing these issues by focusing metrics on strategic \\nobjectives, applying debiasing techniques to improve decision making, developing \\ncapabilities to perform rapid strategic options analysis, and prioritising projects within \\nspecific investment categories.Exhibit 1\\nAustralia’s infrastructure investment has grown at over 30 percent a year.\\n2040 2580\\n1070\\n0 550 45\\n 1530 55 7560\\n 35 653\\n212010\\n1731834\\n2013610\\n8486\\n28 41718171477\\n15241172630\\n2119\\n168811\\n19131626\\n4644\\n22 202317\\n2427354454777260\\n4128\\nSocial infraUtilities (energy/power and water/wastewater)\\n2\\nTransportInfrastructure spend per year based a McKinsey IPAT\\n3data of projects above A$50m\\nA$ Billions1\\nSOURCE: IPAT probable spend data for projects value > A$50m adju sted by the probability of projects to achieve completion and then divided over the duration of the project1 Converted from US$ using April 2019 conversion rate.2 Excludes telecom infrastructure.3 A bottom-up/zero-based approach to estimating spend of projec ts above A$50m and excluding maintenance spend on capital assets+30.5% p.a.Preliminary High Level Estimate4\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperative3. Drive value through design.  Increasingly complex projects expand the difficulties \\nin preventing cost overruns and delays, highlighting the need for a more innovative \\napproach at project design stage. Currently, decisions are often taken from a capital \\nworks perspective rather than a whole-of-life optimisation frame, while there can often \\nbe a lack of integrated perspective and ownership. Project owners are frustrated by \\ntraditional value-engineering approaches that tend to achieve only incremental benefits \\nand take months or years. Moreover, projects can suffer from misaligned incentives, \\nwhile regulations can hinder design innovation. Ways forward include combining an agile \\napproach with design-to-value methodology, incorporating a rigorous framework for \\nprogressive, continuous, and stage-gated design, while also industrialising aspects of \\nthe\\xa0design process.\\n4. Innovate the commercial framework. Aspects of the market’s traditional risk-\\ntransfer model are leading to declining competition within public tenders for transport \\ninfrastructure projects, as the scale and risks associated with them—as well as the \\ncosts of bidding—climb. At the same time, MGI research5 suggests that contractors and \\nsuppliers consider contractual structures and incentives to be the principal hurdle to \\nachieving better outcomes on projects—transaction complexity and regulatory burden \\nadd unnecessary cost and delays and prevent high productivity. In addition, the impact \\nof multiple construction projects can be a significant issue for communities. To address \\nthese issues, stakeholders should consider streamlining the regulatory burden, increasing \\ncollaboration in contracting, reforming the tender process to promote competition, and \\nbundling contracts to take advantage of economies of scale.\\n5. Build industry capacity and capability. There are shortages with regard to capability \\nand capacity of suitably qualified and experienced personnel required to plan and \\ndeliver new infrastructure projects. We analysed three potential future scenarios and \\nfound that Australia could potentially need an additional 260  thousand to 385 thousand \\ninfrastructure construction workers over the coming years (Exhibit 2), if the projected \\npipeline materialises. There is an immediate need for more skilled workers, likely to be \\nexacerbated by the coming ramp-up of mining production—potentially leading to labour \\ninflation. Ways to bridge the capacity and capability gap going forward include managing \\nboth the demand for workers and their supply, including upskilling the current workforce, \\nreframing the culture of the industry to retain more talent, and seeking ways to increase \\nthe talent pool and train the future workforce.\\n6. Enhance productivity through technology. Stagnation in construction productivity \\nglobally results in high costs for the taxpayer and significant project margin erosion \\nfor contractors. Ninety-eight percent of construction projects incur cost or schedule \\noverruns, while lagging labour productivity is a key source of construction challenges. \\nImproving on-site execution through well-executed practices such as lean construction \\ntechniques, performance management, effective project management supported by an \\nactive project management office (PMO) and control tower with efficient planning and \\nproject controls can help boost productivity by up to 10 percent—this is fundamental and \\nneeds to underpin all efforts in boosting productivity. However, we do not believe this will \\nbe enough and the sector will need technology to help it make the step change necessary \\nto bridge its productivity gap. McKinsey research indicates that technology is the most \\npromising lever for improving productivity, with approximately a 15 percent impact—for \\nexample, 47 percent of the work done in construction has automation potential.\\n5 McKinsey Global Institute Construction Productivity Insights Survey.5\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperativeDrawing inspiration from infrastructure innovation and best practices globally (as well as from \\nother sectors) can help Australia’s infrastructure sector achieve a step change in innovation—\\nensuring the next wave of infrastructure projects are successful in their outcomes. Here, \\nwe offer a number of critical takeaways for specific key stakeholder groups: government, \\ninvestors, and contractors.\\nGovernment. As the ultimate funder of public infrastructure (accountable to residents for \\ntimely, effective, and affordable provision) and with responsibility for the policy, legal, and \\nregulatory framework, government should consider how to:\\n —Publish an integrated vision for how technology will shape the way that people and \\nfreight move around a city—this will involve making purposeful choices around Australia’s \\nfuture target state in relation to mobility, smart cities, and the implications of automation, \\ncapturing and articulating the implications of these trends and resulting choices for the \\nallocation of capital.  \\n —Identify and address the major policy enablers and barriers to the adoption of \\ninfrastructure innovations, while successfully managing the transition towards the future \\nstate enshrined in the vision. Government will need to set standards that mandate the \\nadoption of technologies in the delivery of major infrastructure assets—for example, \\n5D\\xa0BIM (building information modelling) where beneficial.\\n —Rethink the way projects are prioritised and selected by developing the capability to \\nperform rapid options analysis, while reorienting formal business-case analysis to avoid \\nsimplifying projects to single (potentially misleading) metrics and focus on scenarios that \\ntake future disruptions into account.\\n —Develop the necessary internal capabilities to manage the portfolio of infrastructure \\nmegaprojects through their lifecycle. This is a non-delegable set of capabilities driven \\nby government’s unique position as the integrator and ultimate owner of all risk and \\nwill include working with industry to conduct a collaborative design-to-value process, \\nadopting an agile approach.Exhibit 2\\nAustralia  faces significant demand for additional resources for infrastructure construction\\nSOURCE: ABS, IPAT, McKinsey analysis Calculated historical employment1Projected employment demand2 01,000\\n 500 700\\n 400\\n 100 200 300 600 900 800 1,100 1,200\\n23 2013 1814 15 16 17 19 20 21 22 2024 1.17 total number of people employed  in construction sector in 2018\\n~775K Peak demand in 2020\\n50%Incremental demand on 2018\\n~260KAdditional need~800K Peak demand in 2020\\n55%Incremental demand on 2018\\n~290KAdditional need~900K Peak demand in 2020\\n75%Incremental demand on 2018\\n~385KAdditional need2018 actual productivity +10% productivity CAGR\\n2018 productivity Last 5 years average productivity Estimated employment demand in infrastructure construction sector\\nThousands\\nProductivity improvementsConservativeDownside casePreliminary High Level Estimate\\n1.

In the early 1990s, Australia established \\na private infrastructure market, adopting public-private partnerships (PPPs) for road and \\nairport programs. More recently, asset recycling in New South Wales (such as the sale of \\nTransGrid in 2016) released vital funds for investment in projects such as Westconnex and \\nNewcastle Light Rail. The PPP model has proved successful in bringing private capital and \\nexpertise to the delivery of public infrastructure (albeit that there were some early failures). \\nAustralia’s approach to infrastructure funding and delivery—including the hypothecated asset \\nrecycling model—has led to it being considered in other sophisticated economies, including \\nthe United States. \\nMeanwhile, Australia has become a leader in private infrastructure investment as managed \\nfunds seek opportunities in this sector, fuelled by the government’s introduction of \\ncompulsory superannuation arrangements. Australian investors and investment managers \\n(for example, Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets, IFM Investors, AMP Capital) and \\ndevelopers (such as toll-road operator Transurban) are now major global players.

Australia’s population is projected to grow from 24.6 million \\nin 2018 to 40.6 million in 2050,8 driven by growth in the country’s two major cities, Sydney \\nand Melbourne, are expanding annually at 1.8 percent and 2.5 percent respectively.9 To meet \\nthe demands of this rapid population growth in its urban centres, Australia is investing in \\ntransport infrastructure on an unprecedented scale, up from around A$26 billion in 2016 to an \\nestimated A$75 billion in 2020 (Exhibit 5). \\nYet, despite the current and planned pace and scale of infrastructure investment, rising \\npopulation growth and the need to replace end-of-life assets mean Australia faces a \\nsubstantial infrastructure gap—the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) report, Bridging \\ninfrastructure gaps, has the world made progress? estimates the gap between Australia’s \\ncurrent infrastructure investment levels and needs (2017–35) to be 1 percent of GDP,10 which \\nimplies a high-level estimated average spending gap of between A$10 billion and A$15 billion \\nper year until 2035. Australia will need to close this gap while simultaneously addressing \\nthe traditional challenges associated with delivering major projects on budget, not least \\nthe sheer scale, pace, and inherent complexity of the infrastructure program. According \\nto Grattan Institute, over the period 2000 to 2015/6, budget overruns on major Australian \\ngovernment transport projects totalled A$28 billion.11 Meanwhile, a number of new challenges \\nhave appeared over the horizon, adding further complexity to the issues just described. \\n8 Population Projections, Australia, 2017 (base)—2066, Australian Bureau of Statistics , abs.gov.au.\\n9 ABC news.com, March 29 2019, https://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/australian-economy/sydney-is-\\nshedding-established-residents-while-darwin-is-shedding-people-full-stop/news-story/4935683a798f5a5216b0\\n23fd8e610dc2, and Australia Bureau of Statistics on population growth, https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/\\nlatestProducts/3218.0Media%20Release12017-18\\n10 Bridging Infrastructure Gaps, Has the World Made Progress?, McKinsey Global Institute,  October 2017 − https://\\nwww.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/capital%20projects%20and%20infrastructure/our%20\\ninsights/bridging%20infrastructure%20gaps%20has%20the%20world%20made%20progress/bridging%20\\ninfrastructure%20gaps%20how%20has%20the%20world%20made%20progress%20v2/mgi-bridging-\\ninfrastructure-gaps-discussion-paper.ashx\\n11 Marion Terrill, Cost overruns in transport infrastructure, Grattan Institute , October 2016.Exhibit 5\\nAustralia’s infrastructure investment is growing at over 30 percent a year.\\n 56080\\n50\\n10 65\\n070\\n30 45 55\\n 35 75\\n 15 25204010\\n182114168\\n2013242027\\n1584171816843\\n173413\\n77 31726\\n2868\\n17441110\\n192241\\n21619\\n46\\n20233028126354454777260\\n4127\\nSocial infraUtilities (energy/power and water/wastewater)\\n2\\nTransportInfrastructure spend per year based a McKinsey IPAT\\n3data of projects above A$50m\\nA$ Billions1\\nSOURCE: IPAT probable spend data for projects value > A$50m adju sted by the probability of projects to achieve completion and then divided over the duration of the project1 Converted from US$ using April 2019 conversion rate.2 Excludes telecom infrastructure.3 A bottom-up/zero-based approach to estimating spend of projec ts above A$50m and excluding maintenance spend on capital assetsPreliminary High Level Estimate\\n+30.5% p.a.10\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperativeAustralia needs to address a raft of emerging trends that threaten to disrupt the next wave of \\ninfrastructure megaprojects, and this brings a new set of challenges, specifically how to:\\n1. Future proof new assets/investments —technology, digital, and data analytics are \\ndisrupting urban mobility, leading to uncertainty around future major investments, as well \\nas the way in which infrastructure assets are constructed and operated.\\n2. Rethink project selection and prioritisation —the current processes by which projects \\nare developed and assessed do not facilitate rapid needs-based prioritisation, as well as \\nthe need to be more “shovel-ready” by going to market with the right projects quicker. \\n3. Drive value through design —increasingly complex projects expand the difficulties in \\npreventing cost overruns and delays, highlighting the need for a more innovative approach \\nat project design stage.\\n4. Innovate the commercial framework —aspects of the market’s traditional risk-transfer \\nmodel are contributing to insufficient competition within tenders for public transport \\ninfrastructure projects, as the scale and risks associated with those projects, and the \\ncosts associated with bidding, climb. \\n5. Build industry capacity and capability —there are shortages with regard to capability \\nand capacity of suitably qualified and experienced personnel required to plan and deliver \\nnew infrastructure projects. \\n6. Enhance productivity through technology —stagnation in construction productivity \\nglobally results in high costs for the taxpayer and significant project margin erosion for \\ncontractors, which in the most extreme circumstances have led to corporate failures \\n(for example, Carillion). Technology presents the biggest opportunity to improve and \\ndrive\\xa0productivity. \\nIn the face of the disruption created by these emerging trends, one thing is clear: the \\nstrengths that have propelled Australia to a leadership position in infrastructure planning, \\ndesign, and delivery will not be sufficient to underpin its future success. \\nAustralia can innovate the way it plans and delivers infrastructure to \\nmeet future challenges\\nSo how best to move forward? Drawing inspiration from infrastructure innovation and best \\npractices globally (as well as from other sectors) can help Australia’s infrastructure sector \\nachieve a step change in innovation—ensuring the next wave of infrastructure projects are \\nsuccessful in delivering the target social and economic outcomes. \\nIn the following chapters, we discuss a series of levers around future proofing infrastructure \\ninvestment, rethinking project selection and prioritisation, driving additional value through \\ninnovative approaches to project design, innovating the commercial framework, enhancing \\nindustry capacity and capability, and ways to harness technology to boost productivity. \\nIn discussing these new approaches, this report recognises that public sector infrastructure \\nowners (which account for the vast majority of infrastructure spending in Australia) face highly \\ncontextual challenges and constraints. These include:\\n —Co-dependence between the Commonwealth and state governments to fund and deliver \\ninfrastructure projects—this inevitably influences project selection and design.\\n —Procurement and probity rules may complicate or constrain governments’ ability to \\nexplore more radical procurement methods.\\n —Governments will be particularly sensitive to, and need to solve for, community concerns \\n(for instance, around travel disruption) and political considerations.\\nWe also  note that there are a number of joint public and private sector initiatives, such as the \\nConstruction Industry Leadership Forum, set up to improve infrastructure industry outcomes. \\nHence, this report is intended as a contribution to, and by no means the final word on, \\nAustralia’s thinking on topics that we believe are important to the successful future delivery  \\nof the country’s infrastructure needs. 11\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperativeRethinking the way we deliver infrastructure starts \\nwith assessing the potentially transformative impacts of \\ntechnology and other infrastructure trends on demand.  \\nA deeper  understanding of the technology disruptions affecting infrastructure offers \\ndecision makers the opportunity to be better financial stewards by future proofing design, \\nmaximising asset utilisation, and responding appropriately to new digital asset classes. \\nMultiple shifts, ranging from energy decentralisation to the Internet of Things (IoT), are likely \\nto come together to create profound changes in mobility systems over the next 10 to 15 years. \\nTherefore, today’s infrastructure decisions need to be future proofed against, or at least \\nadapted to, three trends that will reshape the future of infrastructure: \\n1. The future of mobility , with changes in behaviour, transport modes, and usage\\n2. The impact of smart-city technology , and the improved asset utilisation that will be \\npossible from mining data for customer behaviour insights\\n3. The future of work  driven by an increase in automation and remote working.\\nIn addition to the trends above, climate change and associated increasingly onerous \\nregulations, for example on congestion and air pollution, will continue to drive the need for \\nsustainable transportation. Technology presents potential and disruptive solutions in the \\nquest for sustainable mobility.\\nThe impact of these three major trends need to be factored into project selection and \\ninfrastructure design choices, as they will likely have a dramatic influence on transport \\nmegaprojects, which typically have business cases built on the supposedly robust foundation \\nof multi-decade demand profile projections. Going forward, however, incremental sensitivity \\nanalysis of historical demand profiles will not be sufficient to account for these technology-\\ndriven disruptions. \\n1. Future of mobility \\nAs technology advances, the way people move around urban environments is set to change \\nsignificantly, making it hard for infrastructure owners to predict the type and magnitude \\nof demand. Numerous fast-moving technological trends are set to influence the future \\nof\\xa0mobility:12\\n —Acceleration of connectivity and the Internet of Things.  By 2030, 80 percent \\n(29\\xa0percent at present) of vehicles will be equipped with embedded connectivity, with \\n40 percent of consumers expected to switch car brands for better connectivity and \\n44 percent expected to allow car to track driving pattern and behaviour, and report to \\ninsurance provider, e.g. to personalise insurance policy.\\n —Increased vehicle electrification. From 2014 to 2018 the global electric vehicle (EV) \\nmarket grew by 60 percent per year, reaching 2.1 million newly registered vehicles in 2018, \\npartly helped by the falling average price of lithium-ion battery packs. EV market share \\nis expected to reach ~30 to 45 percent of vehicles sold in in Europe, US, and Canada by \\n12 McKinsey Centre for Future Mobility—studies, analysis and consumer surveys, 2018 and 2019Chapter 1: Future proofing \\ninfrastructure investment 12\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperative2030, with 133 million to 190 million EVs expected to be on the roads in China, US, and the \\nEuropean Union by 2030. At the same time, electric buses remain the fastest-growing \\nEV segment (growing at 100 percent CAGR since 2013) and are expected to comprise \\n75\\xa0percent of new bus sales in Europe by 2030—indeed, current-year bus sales in China \\nare over 90 percent electric.\\n —Growing demand for shared mobility. Meanwhile, the shared mobility market size is \\nalready large and growing rapidly. Across China, the European Union, and the United \\nStates the combined mobility market was over US$50 billion in 2016, and it has the \\npotential to grow by 15 to 30 percent annually through to 2030.\\n —Availability of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Manufacturers suggest that fully autonomous \\n(Level 4) cars may be available as early as 2020, and over the next decade, the technology \\nis expected to mature enough to enable fully autonomous vehicles. Regardless of the rate \\nof adoption, the system should be robust enough to be able to cover majority of passenger \\nmiles. Helped by acceleration in connectivity and IoT plus reduced cost, a pooled self-\\ndriving taxi can be up to 60 percent cheaper than traditional ride-hailing services and \\nbecome competitive with private cars and public transit.\\nWe expect these trends to have several implications for Australia’s future infrastructure needs:\\n —Increased stress on an already stressed infrastructure. In an unconstrained \\nadoption scenario, where regulators do little to support or guide these trends through, \\ninfrastructure upgrades or policy, mobility trends may result in more cars on roads instead \\nof less and commuter behaviours, in some cases, shifting away from public transport.\\n• More vehicles on the road. In the short to medium term, private cars (whether human \\noperated or autonomous) are expected to maintain their dominance, particularly \\nin less densely populated Australian cities. Moreover, empty autonomous vehicles \\nand robo-taxis are likely to roam and run errands (rather than remaining parked) and \\nsingle occupancy vehicles may rise. The combination of these effects could increase \\ncongestion in cities by more than 15 percent,13 associated with more cars on the street \\ndue to transportation of passengers and goods, for example in the AV case with new \\nbusiness models (for example, consignment stock on wheels circling your block), leading \\nto increased demand for road infrastructure. \\n• Impact on public transit. In the 2020s, the costs of commuting via public transit versus \\nshared, self-driving vehicles may converge. Some travellers could decide to shift—\\noccasionally or structurally—from public transit to shared mobility, as the economics of \\na door-to-door on-demand offering become more compelling. A simulation model done \\nby McKinsey for the city of Chicago showed adoption of affordable, low-capacity could \\nreduce share of mass public transit by ~50 percent.14\\n —Increased need for vehicle charging infrastructure. In general, charging facilities \\nand road infrastructure will need to develop to accommodate and stimulate the uptake \\nof electric and autonomous vehicles. The location and type of charging infrastructure \\nrequired is likely to be different for private EVs versus future shared, self-driving vehicles—\\nfor example, the latter would have higher utilisation, favouring fast-charging methods, and \\ncould drive autonomously to charging locations in low-cost locations. \\n —Staging areas. AV fleets and shared-ride services will need areas to idle when picking up \\nor discharging passengers; suitable locations might be provided by converting existing \\nparking spots into staging areas accessible to multiple fleet operators.15\\n —Curb modifications. In most cities, the curb predominantly serves as a space for \\nparking. Going forward, transportation leaders could consider pricing curb space more \\ndynamically, taking demand into account, in order to free up spaces and optimise usage. \\n13 An integrated perspective on the future of mobility, part 3: Setting the direction toward seamless mobility,  \\nhttps://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/sustainability/our%20insights/the%20\\nroad%20to%20seamless%20urban%20mobility/an-integrated-perspective-on-the-future-of-mobility-part-3-vf.ashx\\n14 McKinsey Centre for Future of Mobility\\n15 A new look at autonomous-vehicle infrastructure, McKinsey & Company , May 201913\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperativeThis could reduce congestion associated with vehicles circling the block, looking for \\nunder-priced street parking—a current problem that will extend into the AV world of the \\nfuture. At the same time, designating curb space for specific purposes at different times \\n(using signs or beacons that send signals to AVs) could further help reduce congestion. \\nFor example, during rush hour, the curb might be a pickup site for AV shuttles that are part \\nof the public transportation system.16  \\n2. Smart cities—managing demand and improving commuter time \\nand safety\\nSimilarly, increasing adoption of smart-city technology over coming years has the potential \\nto bring multiple benefits to citizens but also have a profound impact on future infrastructure \\nrequirements. In this report, we focus on smart city applications within the mobility domain, \\nand define a smart city as a digital overlay on our day-to-day infrastructure—that is the \\nnetwork of sensors that collects data from existing assets; the applications and analytical \\nbrainpower that generate insights from this data; and the adoption of technology and changes \\nin behaviour by citizens to utilise their infrastructure in a smarter way.  \\nGlobally, numerous cities are investing in this digital overlay and achieving dramatic quality-\\nof-life improvements for inhabitants, although even the “smartest” cities are only realising a \\nfraction of the potential benefits. In a recent McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) report,17 50 cities \\nwere assessed on their deployment of smart infrastructure in three areas: the strength of the \\ntechnology base, number and extent of applications, and public usage and satisfaction. This \\nresearch showed that Australian cities (Sydney and Melbourne) are lagging some leading \\nglobal cities, largely due to relatively lower adoption of smart-city technologies by residents. \\nSocietal attitudes towards privacy concerns are a potential barrier to the adoption of smart-\\ncity technologies. Some cities have started to take account of this issue, one example being \\nBarcelona, which is proactively addressing residents’ privacy, data sovereignty, and data \\nsecurity concerns through a strategic technology plan. This focuses on creating an open-\\nsource sensor network that will enable it to retain control of the platform but break down data \\nsilos, while also experimenting with applications that invite the public to weigh in on policy-\\nmaking issues, using technology to increase civic engagement.18\\nBy 2025, cities that deploy a full range of intelligent mobility applications have the potential to:\\n —Cut average commuting times by 15 to 20 percent, with some workers enjoying even \\nmore substantial reductions. For the average commuter, this translates into getting back \\n15 to 30 minutes every workday—or two to four full days every year. \\n —Increase road utilisation through smarter traffic management and provision of data and \\nanalytics for autonomous vehicles, potentially reducing the need for new road projects. \\n —Improve commuter safety through provision of improved traffic information, more \\nsophisticated traffic policing, facilitating autonomous driving, and reducing emergency \\nresponse times by 20 to 35 percent.\\n —Enhance asset life and optimise spend on sustaining capital expenditure (capex)  \\nthrough predictive maintenance. \\n —Reduce greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions by 3%-5%17 through a range of Potential \\nmobility-related interventions for smart cities.\\nWe have identified various (non-exhaustive) smart-city interventions relating to transit and \\nmobility with relevance to infrastructure (see sidebar “Potential mobility-related interventions \\nfor smart cities”). All of them have an impact on mobility patterns and create modal shifts that \\nneed to be considered as part of future transport planning. \\n16 A new look at autonomous-vehicle infrastructure, McKinsey & Company,  May 2019\\n17 Smart Cities: Digital Solutions for A More Livable Future, McKinsey Global Institute,  June 2018.\\n18 Barcelona: Smart city revolution in progress, Financial Times , October 25, 2017.14\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperativePotential mobility-related interventions for smart cities\\n —Public transit —real-time information, interconnected mobility by multi-modal \\noffers (such as apps), scheduling and demand-based micro transit, modern \\nticketing\\xa0systems, and digital payment in public transit.\\n —Cars and traffic —predictive maintenance, intelligent traffic signals, \\ncongestion pricing, real-time road navigation, dynamic speed limits, \\ndedicated\\xa0multi-person\\xa0lanes.  \\n —Smart parking —intelligent park guidance system and dynamic tariffs.\\n —Other alternative concepts —sharing (car, bike, scooter), smart parcel.\\n3. Future of work and automation of the workplace\\nAutomation of the workplace offers the potential to add up to A$5.8 trillion (US$4 trillion) \\nto Australia’s economy.19 At the same time, it has far-reaching implications for Australia’s \\ninfrastructure needs. Crucially, given population and sector dispersal, the level of job \\ndisplacement will range from a low of 21 percent in inner cities to a high of about 31 percent \\nin some outer suburban and remote areas. While precise travel patterns and changes to \\nbusiness and living locations remain uncertain, one impact is clear: forthcoming major \\ninfrastructure planning (transport, energy, utilities) must factor in shifting demographics \\nbased on the future of work. The questions to be answered include: Where will work be \\nconcentrated and, based on this, where will communities thrive, what impact will this have on \\nwork commutes, where will communities dwindle, and what infrastructure should we build \\nto\\xa0serve them?\\nThese disruptions create new infrastructure investment demand and opportunities for \\nthe private sector…\\nThese three macrotrends and the disruptions they bring with them will also create instances \\nof new asset classes. In most cases, these will pertain to smart cities, examples being EV \\ncharging infrastructure within cities, improved shared mobility infrastructure, and smart \\ngrid investment. For the private sector, this introduces new investment opportunities that \\nmay provide attractive economic returns. From a public-sector perspective, these new \\nasset classes may increase the number and diversity of projects competing for funding \\nand\\xa0selection. \\n… And affect multibillion-dollar decisions being made today—derisking a priority for \\ngovernment and public authorities\\nWith such volatile macro-trends (future of mobility, smart cities, and future of work), \\ngovernments and public transport authorities clearly cannot sit and wait for these technology \\ndisruptions to play out in real time. Infrastructure decisions need to be made today. And they \\nneed to be made in a way that future proofs (as comprehensively as possible) megaprojects \\nagainst a range of potential outcomes, taking the already changing customer preferences and \\nnew technologies into account. \\n19 Australia’s Automation Opportunity: Reigniting Productivity, McKinsey.com,  March 2019.15\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperativePractically, we suggest five shifts at the city level:\\n —An integrated vision for how technology could affect the way that people and freight \\nmove around the city. An integrated view is needed for how these macro trends will \\nimpact the movement of people and goods. This will be highly city specific, and depend \\nheavily on the relevant demographics, existing infrastructure, prevalent industrial \\nsectors, and likelihood of adoption by citizens. An integrated view will require cooperation \\nwith other infrastructure stakeholders as each new technology will come with costs \\nand benefits to a variety of stakeholders, including infrastructure users, infrastructure \\noperators, regulators, and financing bodies. As such, each of these stakeholders brings \\ndifferent perspectives to how to prepare infrastructure for the future of mobility.\\n —Development of scenarios around the impact on transport infrastructure demand \\ngenerated by radical shifts in technology. Participants can start by developing a few \\nlikely scenarios describing possible future needs. These scenarios should consider \\nupcoming technological developments as well as varying user preferences, and also \\nhighlight the expected socioeconomic benefits—outlining an approach to maximise them. \\nFor these purposes, sensitivity analyses and statistical techniques (such as Monte Carlo \\nanalyses) are insufficient to cater for the multiplicative impact of the three macro trends \\ndescribed above. Instead, governments and infrastructure investors can explicitly model \\nthese scenarios and understand the leading indicators for each: for instance, they can \\nperform a geospatial, agent-based simulation to understand how travellers might behave \\nand undertake scenario planning for a city as a whole.\\n —Translation of scenarios into future-proofed strategic prioritisation of capital and \\nresources at a portfolio and project level. These scenarios can then be translated into \\na clear infrastructure development plan that brings a level of specificity to which projects \\nshould be constructed. Project- and portfolio-level decisions will also need to account \\nfor the benefit of flexibility: for example, by valuing the “real options” created through a \\nstepped approach to development with the explicit intention to either discontinue or pivot \\nas circumstances change. It is critical to understand what decisions have to be made \\ntoday, and what decisions can be postponed until further data are available. \\n —Embedding new competencies and processes.20 This includes building capabilities \\naround active mobility planning—enabling multi-modal journeys that are seamless and \\napplying the right pricing logic (e.g. to avoid congestion), as well as finding ways the new \\ntechnology can be synergistic with the invested assets and not undermine their value. \\nIncorporating forward-looking components such as embedded sensors into new, rebuilt, \\nand, existing infrastructure, building electric infrastructure to support charging network, \\nstandard technical specifications that enable data sharing and best-in-class data \\nprivacy standards will pave the way for AVs and other future technologies down the line. \\nHowever, most operators don’t reflect these features in current planning and investment \\ncycles—they tend to plan on a project-by-project basis, backed by a relatively static \\nregulatory framework of technologies that are already approved, widely available, and \\neasily deployed. Preparing for forthcoming faster development cycles and the rollout of \\nvarious integrated platforms will instead require operators to acquire new competencies \\nin planning, maintenance, and operations (often through partnerships with non-traditional \\ntechnology suppliers), potentially by building a separate business unit to bypass standard \\ncompany processes. As an example, Norway has established a separate road agency for \\ninfrastructure innovation, to speed up cost-efficient development and construction of \\nselected highways.\\n20 Building the infrastructure for the future of mobility, McKinsey Voices of Infrastructure, July 2019.16\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperative —Creating a roadmap of initiatives and enabling actions (for example, application \\nof effective regulation and incentives, changes to planning, creation of a “Future \\nMobility Hub”, and setting clear technology standards and safety requirements) to \\ndeliver the vision. In the context of the above, governments and public-sector agencies \\nneed to be able to understand the regulatory and governance ecosystem that will best \\nenable the vision to be delivered. As technology pushes mobility forward, it will be crucial \\nto ensure regulations are in place and rapidly updated. In addition to essential safety tests \\nand approvals, regulations can take many years to design and implement, while innovation \\ncycles can upend industries in under a year. Unaddressed, we expect regulation \\nmodifications to lag five to seven years behind the readiness of technologies such as \\nautonomous driving—delaying the full integration of new technologies into the transport \\nsystem. To expedite and facilitate development of appropriate regulations, manufacturers \\nand operators will need to collaborate with regulators to adapt approval processes and \\nhelp keep pace with accelerated technology development. Regulators, manufacturers, \\nand operators need to work together on putting in place the right regulations and \\nincentives as well as the enabling initiatives required to knit together forecasting, decision \\nmaking, and execution of future infrastructure needs to effectively improve performance \\non the five indicators21 that characterise a transit system (availability, affordability, \\nefficiency, convenience, and sustainability).22\\n• Availability —Enable infrastructure to accommodate more passenger-kilometres \\nthrough increased access to seamless mobility that is inclusive of all residents by \\nexpanding accessibility and affordability of shared mobility in underserved areas such \\nas lower income communities. \\n• Affordability —Reduce cost per trip by providing mobility choices that are equitable \\nand affordable for all. For example, In June 2019, the Washington D.C. transit agency \\nannounced that ride-hailing heavyweight Lyft will soon begin providing shared rides for \\nlate-night workers in the D.C. area under a one-year pilot program Metro is launching to \\nhelp make up for the lack of early-morning service on its rail system. The transit agency \\nannounced in a release Monday that people can apply for the program, which involves \\nan up to $3 subsidy per ride for as many as 40 rides per month, for service starting \\nJuly\\xa01\\xa02019.23\\n• Efficiency —Reduce congestion and average time travelled per trip through zoning, \\nstreamlined traffic-related fees and taxes into an integrated congestion price structure, \\nV2I technology for curbside congestion and parking management, zombie taxes for \\nrobo-taxis and improved efficiency of public transit systems.\\n• Convenience —Increase the number of point-to-point trips through a seamless mobility \\nexperience guided by data transparency and privacy through implementation of a \\nsmart ticketing system, electronic services, integrated data infrastructure to support \\nmultimodal platform and traffic management applications etc.\\n• Sustainability —Reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enable a system that \\ncontributes to more sustainable, healthy and liveable communities by promoting \\nand enabling and incentivising the adoption of personal and shared EVs, and fully \\nelectrifying public transit and sub-contracted public transit systems.\\n\\u2003\\n21 An integrated perspective on the future of mobility, part 3: Setting the direction toward seamless mobility, https://www.\\nmckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/sustainability/our%20insights/the%20road%20to%20\\nseamless%20urban%20mobility/an-integrated-perspective-on-the-future-of-mobility-part-3-vf.ashx\\n22 McKinsey Center for Mobility City Pilot – Future Urban Mobility, April 2019\\n23 Curbed Washington DC https://dc.curbed.com/2019/6/25/18758594/metro-wmata-late-night-service-lyft-rides17\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperativeIn an environment where potential infrastructure projects \\nfar exceed the finite capital budget available to build \\nthem, the first critical lever to consider is optimising \\nproject\\xa0selection.\\nWhile infrastructure investment decisions inevitably involve political considerations, it is \\ncritical to ensure these decisions are founded on a robust and consistent fact base. A core \\nelement of infrastructure decision making is the business case; this analyses the costs and \\nbenefits of a project and sets out the arguments for proceeding or rejecting it (see sidebar \\n“Australia’s current approach to business case evaluation”). Australia’s approach to business-\\ncase development is relatively mature, being sophisticated and methodical—for example, \\nevery Commonwealth infrastructure proposal over $100 million is reviewed by Infrastructure \\nAustralia. However, we note that a number of challenges are beginning to emerge.\\nAustralia’s current approach to business case evaluation\\nTwo metrics underpin the core of most business-case evaluations: the benefit-cost ratio \\n(BCR) and net present value (NPV). BCR is the most commonly referred to metric when \\ncomparing projects. Wider economic, social, and environmental benefits are considered \\nin a qualitative manner.\\nFive challenges to the traditional business case–led approach to project selection \\nand\\xa0prioritisation:\\n1. Limitations of the benefit-cost ratio.  BCR remains a useful metric to understand and \\ncompare a project’s value. However, we also see fundamental flaws in this method: it can \\ncreate false precision  by reducing projects to summary statistics and can be susceptible to \\nbias. BCR and net present value (NPV) simplify what are often complex, multifaceted project \\nconsiderations into single numbers. The upside is that this makes it easy to communicate \\nand explain a project’s value to stakeholders; the downside is that it creates a false sense of \\nprecision. Not only is it nearly impossible to accurately predict future costs and benefits of \\na project, as the drivers of these are complex and difficult to model, but BCR and NPV are \\nboth highly sensitive to changes in core assumptions—for example, discount rate. Moreover, \\nthese metrics cannot and do not cover every relevant consideration when it comes to project \\nselection. Some factors, such as community support, are difficult to quantify and assess, yet \\nplay an important role in a project’s success. For example, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, now \\na national icon, probably wouldn’t have been built if the original decision had been based \\nsolely on the business case. It didn’t generate a positive cash flow for 20 years, but today \\ncarries over 160,000 vehicles a day and generates significant cultural and tourism benefits \\nfor the city. Equally estimates tend not to take account of factors such as flexibility or the \\npotential impact of disruptive mobility trends. Chapter 2: Rethinking project \\nselection and prioritisation18\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperative2. The business case process can suffer from inherent bias. This can inflate project \\nbenefits, and also appear to favour public opinion or decisions already taken. More helpful \\nwould be a focus on potential scope and delivery options—with differential customer \\nand community outcomes—for government consideration. Kahneman and Tversky (and \\nsubsequent behavioural economists) found that optimism bias applies to both estimates of \\ncosts and benefits. Thus, errors of estimation do not cancel each other out, as Hirschman \\nwould have it—the exact opposite happens, errors generally reinforce each other. Indeed, \\nas of 2006, the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Switzerland will not fund projects that do \\nnot address the potential for optimism bias in their business cases.24 \\n3. Project selection will always be political to some extent. A common refrain within the \\ninfrastructure sector is that infrastructure decisions can be influenced by the political \\ncycle. Over the ten years 2006–16, swing states received 46 percent more federal \\nfunding per capita for transport infrastructure than other states.25 Marginal seats received \\nalmost 3.5 times more infrastructure funding than safer seats.26 Decision makers need \\nto make trade-offs in view of political considerations; however, there is an opportunity to \\nhelp make these decisions better informed. In many cases, it appears megaprojects are \\nannounced by governments well before a business case and options analyses have been \\ncompleted, leading to analysis sometimes being undertaken to justify projects that will go \\nahead regardless of the outputs. \\n4. The process is time-consuming.  The extensive business case work that is usually \\ncarried out for a major project can take over 12 months to prepare, yet these timelines, as \\ndiscussed above, are often incompatible with decision timeframes—election cycles and \\nfunding availability often mean that project decisions are made and announced before the \\nbusiness case can be completed. At the same time, the process is also resource-intensive. \\n5. Selection and prioritisation of spend are not always carried out on comparable \\nprojects. Projects with different objectives and diverse expressions of costs and \\nbenefits need to be evaluated differently. Yet, metrics such as BCR and NPV encourage \\ncomparison and relative “ranking” of projects with vastly different objectives and contexts. \\nIn many cases, such comparisons are not meaningful in practice, as the projects are too \\ndifferent and should be assessed against criteria more specific to each one (Exhibit 6)—\\nhence this approach can unfairly deprioritise projects. For example, some rural projects \\nare unlikely to have a favourable business case vis-à-vis urban projects if these types \\nof project are directly compared one with another, despite the underlying drivers for the \\ntwo types of project being vastly different. A further issue with business case evaluations \\nis that the methods of calculating BCR and NPV can vary, with different assumptions \\nand inclusions used depending on the project and the proponent. Existing guidelines \\non business case preparation are applied inconsistently,27 making it difficult to compare \\ndifferent projects using these numbers. \\n24 Bent Flyvbjerg, What You Should Know About Megaprojects, and Why: An Overview, Draft 9.2, 2014\\n25 https://grattan.edu.au/report/roads-to-riches/\\n26 https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/the-1-billion-cost-of-pork-barrelling-revealed-20180117-h0judh.html\\n27 https://www.asbec.asn.au/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/171018-ASBEC-Bang-for-Buck.pdf19\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperativeFour ways to improve our approach to project selection \\n —Focus business-case analysis on “what really matters”. We can improve analytical \\nrigour during business-case evaluation by ensuring metrics are tightly linked to strategic \\nobjectives and account for different future scenarios, so the metrics will more accurately \\nreflect reality. Equally, if state governments and project proponents nationwide can use \\nconsistent methodologies when evaluating business cases, this will make it easier to \\ncompare projects accurately. \\n —Apply debiasing techniques to improve decision making. Cognitive bias can skew \\ndecision making and outcomes via the judgments that people make. Although it is \\nimpossible to fully decouple cognitive bias from infrastructure investment decisions, one \\nway to keep this in check is through conscious inclusion of debiasing techniques and \\nbroader awareness of behavioural economics. \\nAlthough individuals will always struggle to overcome biases on their own, organisations \\ncan succeed with the support of systems.28 Best-practice organisations have explicit \\ndiscussions around uncertainty, fully transparent criteria for approval, and create an \\natmosphere where debate is directed by skills and experience (not hierarchy). Such \\norganisations actively search for information to contradict the investment hypothesis. \\nFor\\xa0example, in the private equity (PE) sector, investment decisions are debiased through \\na number of systematic countermeasures. These range from the deeply analytical (such \\nas real-options valuation and reference-class forecasting), through to practical social \\ndynamics (such as “pre-mortems” and “devil’s advocate”). Some investment companies \\nalso run an “anti-portfolio” to track their decision making retrospectively. This allows them \\nto identify investments they missed out on, reflect on what decisions they should have \\nmade, and incorporate past learnings into future decision making.\\n28 Daniel Kahneman, Nobel Prize Winner in Economics and McKinsey work on Behavioral Economics and Debiasing \\nInvestment Decisions March 2018.Exhibit 6\\nInfrastructure projects can vary widely in terms of how their costs and benefits \\nare\\xa0expressed—and need to be evaluated differently.\\nExampleProjects where benefits are largely social (equity, health, environment) and difficult to quantify in economic termsP\\narks\\nTypically publicly funded with no user feesMost benefits intangible, such as improved health, better air quality, or increased sense of community, and require societal agreement on their valueEconomic returns/cost-benefit analysis\\nProjects with discrete revenue streams and clear costs can be evaluated in purely financial termsW\\nireless telecom\\nTypically private competition, and user fees cover costs Investment decisions on a purely financial basis (net present value, return on investment)Financial returnsSocial cost-benefit analysis\\nProjects where both financial returns and economic spill-over effects need to be quantifiedT\\noll highways, roads\\nToll revenue assessable in terms of return on investment (ROI)Non-financial economic costs and benefits (e.g. mobility and higher economic activity) justify additional charges or subsidies and require evaluation in economic terms\\nSOURCE: McKinsey Global Institute analysis20\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperativeInfrastructure decision-making organisations can consider formally embedding such roles \\nand structures to minimise bias. These structures should drive analysis and encourage \\nthe use of organisational, analytical, and debate countermeasures. Incorporating these \\ntechniques will help to ensure infrastructure project selection is linked back to the \\nobjective function (ensuring an outcome that optimises benefits and cost issues based on \\nthe specific underlying constraints and decision factors).\\n —Develop the capability to perform rapid options analysis. The extended timeframes \\nassociated with business-case development conflict with shorter decision-making \\ntimeframes, limiting their usefulness. Instead of relying on long, detailed business cases, \\ngovernments and other infrastructure investors can undertake rapid strategic options \\nanalysis during the very early stages of an infrastructure proposal with key high-level \\ndecision makers (for example, at secretary and minister level). Such analysis would be \\ntimely enough to inform decisions before they are announced, as opposed to being used \\nto justify decisions retrospectively.\\nInfrastructure professionals should consider opportunities to provide robust yet \\ntimely analysis for government decision makers. Government departments could \\nbuild capabilities to be able to rapidly develop, quantify, and assess the customer and \\ncommunity benefits of alternative modal (for instance, autonomous busway versus heavy \\nrail versus light rail versus motorway) and scope options for a new transport corridor, \\nwithin a four-week period. Premiers and senior ministers could be made aware of this \\ncapability, such that rapid options assessment would then be very likely used by the \\ngovernment prior to announcing a specific mega-project. Government may still choose \\nto pursue their preferred project, but it would be an informed choice based on clear \\ntrade-offs presented.\\n —Prioritise infrastructure projects within specific investment categories. To make \\ncomparable investment decisions, project sponsors can allocate potential projects into \\ninvestment categories. Categorising projects will allow sponsors to: 1) allocate capital \\nacross categories, 2) compare and prioritise spend within each category, and 3) ring-fence \\ninvestment decisions from political influences to the extent it is appropriate to do so. \\nWe\\xa0believe Australian decision-making authorities are generally very good at categorising \\ndecisions on the basis of what is mandatory and what is discretionary. However, \\ndiscretionary infrastructure can then be broken down into a further three categories to \\nimprove decision making, using needs-based assessment: additional capacity, extending \\ncoverage, and strategic importance (Exhibit 7). Rather than comparing all discretionary \\nspend projects one to another based on their BCR alone, projects can be grouped into the \\nrelevant decision package, top-down capex envelope set by decision package, bottom-\\nup budgeting done by package, and prioritised within these packages (based on need), \\nenabling more effective project selection (Exhibit 8). Projects can then be prioritised \\nwithin investment categories, across states and across different project types. In \\nAustralia, this would need government to consider infrastructure more holistically (rather \\nthan on an individual project basis).21\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperativeExhibit 7\\nPotential infrastructure projects can be grouped into four investment categories.\\nMandatory Projects that need to be completed to fulfil legal, safety or regulatory requirements Improving safety of electricity infrastructure following Black SaturdayExamplesInvestment driver\\nDiscretionary\\nStrategicProjects of national significance or future strategic importance intended to unlock broader economic or social value Public parks, sporting stadiums\\nCapacityProjects required to provide additional capacity to meet increasing demand High capacity metro trains\\nCoverageProjects required to extend infrastructure coverage to a new area or population Perth Metronet\\nExhibit 8\\nPrioritising projects based on on investment categories enables more effective project selection.\\nIdentify and list upcoming projects for considerationSort each project into the appropriate investment categoryCalculate the estimated BCR and total invest-ment required for each projectIdentify total investment available over the selected time periodDecide on minimum BCR required to warrant investment (e.g. >1)Prioritise funding projects which exceed hurdle rate within the available funding envelopeIdentify potential projectsGroup projects into investment categories Estimate BCR and project costs Identify total funding availableEstablish BCR hurdle rate Selectprojects22\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperativeIntroducing innovative approaches to design can improve \\nproject outcomes.\\nInfrastructure design, of course, has numerous influences on project value across multiple \\ndimensions in terms of costs (both capex and opex), disruption during construction, and \\nproject outcomes (including adaptability for future needs). Indeed, after project selection, the \\nsingle biggest lever to improve outcomes and enhance project value is to introduce innovative \\napproaches to design and engineering (Exhibit 9), and design-to-value frameworks that focus \\non delivering defined benefits and functions at lowest cost. \\nHowever, this opportunity is often missed for five reasons.\\n1. A capital works frame, rather than a whole-of-life optimisation frame. Often, capital \\nbudgetary constraints and lack of cross-functional stakeholder involvement in investment \\ndecisions means decision makers can take the “capex view”, versus whole-life cost. On \\noccasion, this can lead towards a design with lower capex but higher opex, in contrast to a \\ndesign with higher capex and a lower total cost of ownership. \\nExhibit 9\\nThe biggest opportunity to influence the cost and outcome of the project \\nis\\xa0during\\xa0the\\xa0design\\xa0phase.\\nSOURCE: Construction Industry Institute and McKinsey analysisAbility to influence final cost over project life\\nTimeAbility to influence costHigh\\nLowStart CompleteHow does design influence project outcome?\\nAbility to influence outcome Capex committedConstructability\\nMore difficult or time consuming to executeOverregulation, unnecessary constraints\\nWrong  project, fettered delivery\\nDesign directly influences construction productivity and project success by influencing time required to complete an activity, including rework\\nCost to changeDesign and EngineeringProject Definition\\nProcurement\\nExecution\\nOperation\\nAmbiguity\\nIncreased # of RFIsNon-coordinate\\nSite instructions, claims\\nErrors\\nRedesign, delays executionOpex\\nIncreases operational cost\\nOverdesign\\nDirect cost of materialsComplexity\\nUnnecessary complexity\\nChapter 3: Driving value \\nthrough innovative \\napproaches to project design23\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperative2. Lack of integrated perspective and ownership. In most cases, project-value analyses \\nare performed at the concept or feasibility phase to clear an investment-decision gate. \\nFrequently, design optimisation is left to engineering teams for consideration, and they \\nmay not understand the trade-offs or be well positioned to take trade-off decisions. \\nDecisions that are not well thought through—for example on employer’s requirements, \\nbasis of design and/or specifications—can destroy project value or, worse, may fail to \\nmeet project objectives. Design optimisation requires a top-down approach based on \\ndefined functions to deliver defined benefits, and often requires strong decision makers \\nwith good judgement around trade-offs between engineering, construction, cost, \\nbenefits, and future operations—this is not possible unless there is review by a cross-\\nfunctional team. \\n3. Lack of design-to-value framework and capabilities. Unlike, for example, quality \\nassurance or even risk management, most project planning, development and delivery \\ndoes not incorporate a rigorous framework for progressive, continuous, and stage-gated \\ndesign to value or design to cost. \\n4. Misaligned incentives. Where different teams are focused on achieving KPIs under \\nindividual contracts, the engineering consultant may be focused on delivering the design \\ndrawings within a short time span, vendors may seek to reduce cost by adopting off-the \\nshelf solutions, while contractors may be focused on executing/building high earned-\\nvalue tasks to manage their cashflow. The consequent conflicts of interest can result in \\nthe various parties not considering or, worse, being unaware of the implications of their \\ndesign choices. Moreover, both confirmation bias and anchoring29 can complicate capital \\nallocation, which involves making choices in the context of significant uncertainty.\\n5. Regulation preventing design innovation. Where designs are overly constrained either \\nby highly onerous requirements by regulators or overly restrictive approval conditions, \\nvalue can be—and often is—destroyed. Internal stakeholders also impose unnecessary \\nregulation in many ways. For example, standards groups within agencies can stipulate \\noverly restrictive, capital-intensive, and often obsolete standards and specifications; \\nand review processes, such as design or construction certification processes can \\nunintentionally prevent innovation because the risks to project participants (including \\ndelay risk) make changes not worth pursuing, particularly during delivery—this includes, \\nfor example, independent verifiers processes.\\nFour ways to transform infrastructure design \\nThe sheer scale and complexity of the infrastructure program implies a volume of concept and \\ndetailed design work that is very challenging to control if it is to remain consistent with defined \\nproject benefits and functional requirements. Accordingly, stakeholders globally are looking \\nfor ways to move beyond traditional “value engineering” as they seek to capture the cost and \\nschedule reductions required to deal with the scale and complexity of today’s infrastructure \\nmegaprojects. They can look to innovation across four design dimensions.\\n —Apply agile methodologies to the design process. Agile in its simplest form adopts \\na new way of working to break down silos and increase organisations’ metabolic rate. \\nIt brings dedicated contributors from different disciplines into the same room to work \\n“shoulder to shoulder”. Requirements are gathered through discussions and visual design, \\nwhile the business and customers see the output on a weekly basis and “course correct” \\nas necessary. The agile methodology requires longer explanation, but in essence its key \\nfeatures when applied to infrastructure design and development include:\\n• Co-located cross-functional teams (“squads”). A team comprises fully dedicated \\ndesign, procurement, finance, construction, and operations professionals, resulting in \\nfaster and better value engineering trade-offs.\\n29 Confirmation bias refers to the interpretation evidence to affirm existing theories; anchoring refers to a situation where an \\nindividual relies disproportionately on an initial piece of information.24\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperative• Sprints. A key element of the agile approach is for everyone to work in a time-boxed \\nmanner, with regular check-ins (“stand ups”) and report-outs (“showcases”), to produce \\noutputs such as design options. This provides the opportunity to improve output after \\nstage-gate reviews and feedback (for example, through “retrospectives”).\\n• Customer focused. End-user needs are constantly discussed and used to optimise for \\ntime and cost during construction and operation.\\n• Information transparency. This minimises any information asymmetry between owner, \\noperator, contractor, and vendors—better information improves predictability of \\nperformance.\\n —Adopt and institutionalise a zero-based approach to design—“design to value” \\n(DTV).  In contrast to traditional approaches, DTV optimises the design of a selected \\nproject through top-down review based on the business case, including benefits \\nsought (economic, social, environmental), the context and constraints, and functional \\nrequirements, with the intention of identifying the “minimum technical solution” (MTS) that \\ndelivers the requirements—ideally with material capital and whole-of-life cost savings \\nwhile maintaining or improving safety, quality, and constructability baselines in the early \\nstages of design.\\nDTV adopts a cross-functional, cross-organisational approach, working in an integrated \\ndesign team, and potentially includes external stakeholders. The team operates within an \\nagile-inspired framework to rapidly identify and iterate key decision drivers and identify \\nviable alternatives, with frequent touchpoints with senior decision makers. DTV seeks \\nto ensure that project objectives are met, but also that longstanding assumptions or \\npractices are challenged and discussed at senior levels, if they are identified as being \\nbottlenecks to creating significant value. It is important to note that this approach is not a \\nonetime activity; it should be undertaken at various stages of the project and also inform \\nthe procurement process. Where we have seen owners and contractors applying this \\napproach to infrastructure projects, the impact is substantial and well above traditional \\nvalue engineering exercises—benefits captured are often in the range of 15 to 30 percent \\ncost savings. \\n —Industrialise design across a portfolio where appropriate—a manufacturing \\napproach to common design and construction (D&C) elements.  Currently, multiple \\nfactors discussed above combine to prevent a more industrial or production-oriented \\napproach to appropriate project components. Although individual infrastructure projects \\nare generally highly dependent both on their context on the ground (in the natural and built \\nenvironment) and in the community, there is potential for significant savings on design \\nand delivery costs and time on projects. This can drive sustainable medium- to long-term \\nsupply-chain performance by unbundling and managing common elements at a portfolio \\nlevel through a manufacturing or production-based approach. \\nThis needs a broader portfolio concept, not just at institutional level but also across \\ninstitutions and a reframed approach to project engineering. At portfolio level, we believe \\nthat there is opportunity to “productionise” more of the design of the many, somewhat \\nsimilar projects. This can reduce cost, provide greater supply chain certainty, and improve \\nproductivity—so increasing government’s ability to deliver its ambitious programs. \\nExamples include standardisation of designs and specifications and modularisation of \\nsegments, which will not only have an impact on upfront costs (capex) but also on ongoing \\noperations and maintenance costs (opex). \\nGenerally, however, recognising the unique environment of each project—and, within \\nthat context, the dependency of both solutions and services on the specific construction \\nmethods adopted—it is unlikely to be efficient to fully adopt a manufacturing approach. \\nNevertheless, there are numerous common elements across portfolios that could be more \\nefficiently delivered by separate procurement at a portfolio level: for example, precast and \\nmodular components or the supply of ubiquitous materials.25\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperative —Apply framework and capabilities.  Incorporate a rigorous framework for progressive, \\ncontinuous, and stage-gated design to value or design to cost. We suggest that such a \\nprocess should be incorporated into all planning and delivery. It should continue after \\nprocurement and should not be restricted based on contract risk allocation, to ensure \\nthat value is not lost for project participants after risk is allocated, depending on the \\ncircumstances that arise. The process should be based on clear definition of functional \\nrequirements and benefits sought with a continuing focus on delivering the defined \\nfunctions and benefits at the lowest cost. Indeed, any change to the benefits being \\ndelivered should require a resubmitted business case to the project investment decision \\nmakers (often cabinet or its committees).26\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperativeImproving contractual structures and aligning incentives \\nbetween project owners and the supply chain in Australia \\ncan help improve project outcomes and increase market \\nappetite and competition.\\nToday, major public infrastructure projects in Australia tend to be delivered through large \\noutsourced contracts. This involves single-point private sector accountability for delivery \\nof the defined project, and little ability to adjust delivery post-award either to add value \\nor to prevent value destruction. This approach has served Australia reasonably well over \\nan extended period; aspects of current practice (developed in the 1990s) have effectively \\nsolved many of the problems prevalent in the late 20th century, such as a lack of clarity \\naround risk allocation. Nevertheless, in the context of high risk and low or negative profit \\nmargins achieved by contractors, contractual frameworks and the process of procuring \\nprivate-sector counterparties may now benefit from reform, both from a government and a \\nprivate-sector\\xa0perspective. \\nA 2017 study30 of performance outcomes for Tier 1 contractors involved in major PPP and \\nD&C projects completed in Australia since 2000 found that, despite relatively routine \\ninitial tender margins of 6 to 12 percent, actual margins were typically much lower and \\nturned negative in more than 40 percent of cases—sometimes significantly. Outcomes \\nlike this are not sustainable. Indeed, there is current evidence of declining interest in major \\nprojects at a time when industry participation needs to increase to deliver the anticipated \\ninfrastructure pipeline. Tender process and contractual barriers that hamper government \\nand industry’s ability to adapt and innovate during execution need to be addressed. This \\nis particularly important to mitigate negative delivery-phase impacts on the community \\nand wider stakeholders. Encouragingly, government and industry are in the process of \\npursuing initiatives to address some of these identified issues. For example, the 2018 NSW \\nGovernment Action Plan31 aims to improve partnership with the private sector through better \\nprocurement and contracting measures. \\nWe have highlighted five areas in which contracts and procurement practices may be \\ninhibiting optimal outcomes.\\n1. Contractors and suppliers consider contractual structures and incentives to be \\namong the principal hurdles to achieving better project outcomes. A global MGI \\nsurvey among project owners, contractors, and suppliers, which asked respondents to \\nrank the top ten root causes for achieving suboptimal project outcomes, showed that \\ncontractors and suppliers placed contractual structures at the top of the list (Exhibit 10). \\nIn\\xa0the context of constrained supply, this perception among private sector participants \\ncould reduce competition and increase cost in the future.\\n30 Peter Ryan and Colin F. Duffield, Contractor Performance on Mega Projects—Avoiding the Pitfalls, University of \\nMelbourne Paper.\\n31 NSW Government Action Plan: A ten point commitment to the construction sector, NSW Government , June 2018,  \\nhttp://www.infrastructure.nsw.gov.au/media/1649/10-point-commitment-to-the-construction-industry-final-002.pdf.Chapter 4: Innovating the \\ncommercial framework  27\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperative2. Rigid risk allocation contracts often deter collaboration to find better solutions and \\nimprove mutual outcomes. Typical risk allocation contracts are designed to protect \\nagainst project downside—mainly for the owner—and not for post-award cooperation to \\nenable project value improvement. The contract structure and rigid probity environment \\nmake win-win cooperation post-tender submission very difficult and even risky to the \\ncontractor because of time, cost, and liability penalties. Rigid risk allocation can result in \\ncontractor executives focusing valuable time and resources on financial management, \\nrather than productivity enhancement. Meanwhile, the owner can also face disincentives \\nto engage in such cooperation due to probity concerns and the perceived risk of taking \\naccountability away from the contractor. \\nAllocation of all design and construction risk to contractors—with balance-sheet-\\nthreatening liability limits—does not prevent some risks from manifesting, particularly \\nthose that are not fully in the control of the party responsible for that risk. In urban \\ninfrastructure projects, for instance, there are many substantial external risks associated \\nwith the community context, the physical environment, and interfaces. When a project \\ngoes wrong or performs poorly, the owner is always impacted negatively regardless \\nof the contract terms—and measures within contracts such as allocation of financial \\nconsequences often do not adequately prevent or offset the pain. \\nIn these circumstances, it is often in all parties’ interests to seek different outcomes \\nby working together: for example, by adjusting the staging of completion and opening, \\ndespite the contractual implications.Exhibit 10\\nContractual structures cited by contractors and suppliers as the top root cause hindering \\nproject performance.\\nRoot cause Rankings (1 highest, 10 lowest)\\nOverall Contractor Owner Supplier\\n2Contractual structures and incentives are misaligned\\n 1 5\\n 1\\nExtensive regulation and cyclical nature of public investment\\n88 8 7Increasing project and site complexities43 4 3\\nInformality and potential for corruption distort the market\\n1010 10 8Bespoke or suboptimal owner requirements65 6 10\\nIndustry is highly fragmented horizontally and vertically\\n99 9 9Design processes and investment are inadequate1\\n 2\\n 2 4Insufficiently skilled labour at the frontline and supervisory levels\\n34 3 5Poor project-management and execution basics\\n56\\n 1 6Industry underinvests in digitisation, innovation, and capital\\n77 7\\n 2\\nSOURCE: MGI Construction Prod uctivity Insights Survey Note: Number of respondents = 21028\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperative3. Transaction complexity and regulatory burden reduces market interest and can \\nadd unnecessary cost and delays. Australia is continuing to increase its focus on \\nsimplifying tender processes, submission requirements, and the regulatory environment for \\nconstruction by reducing engineering requirements, streamlining permitting and approvals \\nprocesses, reducing the number of procedures, and increasing the quality of rule-making. \\nNonetheless, the cost of tendering and associated regulatory burden remains high—\\nincluding, for example, over 100 planning approval conditions that are often allocated to \\ncontractors, including many outside their control. To offset the high cost burden of bidding \\nfor major projects, government tender costs are sometimes paid in part by government to \\nunsuccessful tenderers; ultimately, of course, this additional cost remains a burden on the \\noverall cost of the asset and the portfolio. Overall, the regulatory and contractual burden \\ncan add to construction cost and delivery duration and, can also act as a significant barrier \\nto design and construction innovation during delivery. Meanwhile, tender process durations \\nof up to two years (from calls for expressions of interest to contract execution) also act as a \\nbarrier to interest from international companies.\\n4. Low contractor confidence in longer-term order book prevents productivity-\\nenhancing investment. Almost every project is separately tendered, even in the context \\nof the major project portfolio, both within and across agencies and states. The resulting \\nuncertainty reduces the incentive for contractors to invest for the longer term—in staffing, \\ntechnology adoption, and equipment—with an inevitable lost opportunity for productivity \\nimprovement. A balance is required between ensuring appropriate competition and \\ncreating certainty. Where governments have tendered programs of work (rather than \\nindividual projects), such as the level-crossing removal program alliances in Victoria, these \\nhave often delivered fast, affordable project and program outcomes. \\nIn recent years, government has been publishing project pipelines, as a way to offer clarity \\nand increase transparency, but these pipelines become less clear as we look forward, \\nbeyond the four-year budget forward estimates. Government is often reluctant to publish \\nplans for longer-term projects prior to firm political commitment, and therefore forward \\nprojections can show activity levels reducing when often government is planning to \\nsustain or increase them. To address this issue, it is possible for suitably qualified medium- \\nto long-term information to be provided to industry without the community or industry \\nperceiving such projections as binding commitments. Greater longer-term transparency \\nand certainty can boost supply chain confidence and commitment, and encourage \\ninvestment. The resulting increased level of preparation and investment can help improve \\nthe quality of bids and construction productivity over the longer term.\\n5. Construction-phase impacts on communities and stakeholders are increasingly \\nimportant in the context of major urban capital works. With major waves of \\nsimultaneous construction across cities, the impact of multiple construction projects can \\nbe a significant issue for communities and wider stakeholders. Delivery-phase impacts \\nand methods of mitigation are fundamental to project success, yet current risk-allocation \\narrangements tend to focus on construction as a solution (what is delivered) rather than \\na service (how it is delivered). Both are important. Many recent projects have been or still \\nare being materially prolonged relative to the tender schedule by unexpected difficulties \\nwith utilities, access, and the legitimate needs of affected communities—this can add \\ncost and cause extended, sometimes increased, disruption. This challenge is likely to be \\nexacerbated in the near future as Sydney and Melbourne undertake major road and rail \\ntunnel projects in their central business districts and surrounding inner suburbs, alongside \\nmajor airport works. 29\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperativeMitigating the issues to deliver additional value\\nIn response to the various issues described we have identified a number of ways to reform the \\nsystem to deliver increased value for stakeholders.  \\n —Streamline the regulatory burden.  Engagement between project owners and external \\nstakeholders—particularly planning authorities, environmental agencies, utility \\ncompanies, and federal bodies—should be enhanced to reduce unnecessary regulation. \\nFor example, reducing rail possession and other hours-of-work restrictions may both \\nimprove performance and improve outcomes for affected communities who may prefer \\nhigher impact over a shorter period. These issues are particularly important given the \\naggregated impact of sustained infrastructure development on communities during \\ndelivery—construction is a service not just a solution.\\nSimilarly, removing all unnecessary technical specificity to boost innovation, reduce \\ncost, and increase flexibility and resilience during delivery can add value. If government \\ncontinues to prefer single-point D&C accountability, industry can be encouraged to \\ninnovate during tender and be allowed to continue to innovate during delivery within the \\nagreed project requirements.\\nEqually, when opportunities arise to increase value or mitigate value destruction during \\ndelivery, such opportunities should be enabled by the regulatory environment. For \\nexample, time-consuming change processes often mean that value-creating changes to \\ndesigns, construction methods, or other initiatives are simply not offered by contractors. \\n —Increase collaboration in contracting. It is now common practice on large projects \\nfor authorities to engage with potential contractors throughout the tender process. \\nHowever, a more effective and innovative contest of ideas could be facilitated through \\ngreater collaboration prior to contract award. While probity processes to “level the \\nplaying field” will remain important, tenderers can be encouraged to capitalise on their \\ncapabilities to challenge the tender requirements in order to create value without the \\nrisk of being non-compliant. In order to increase collaboration post award, contracts \\ncould be adjusted to include suitable proactive responses before or alongside delay or \\ncost claim mechanisms. For example, contracts could mandate that the parties identify \\nand seek to cooperate without prejudice to risk allocations in response to material \\ndelays, disruptions, and value-creating opportunities.\\nFull risk-sharing through alliances is the most comprehensive form of collaboration \\nthrough the life of a project, whereby design, construction, and owners’ risks are shared \\nby the parties rather than allocated. In recent years, alliancing appears to have been \\nused only in very limited circumstances—in some 3–5 percent of cases during 2017–18, \\nalbeit accounting for 10–15 percent of total value across all contracts.32 Properly \\nmanaged, the efficiencies engendered through aligned incentives and the removal of \\ncontractual processes and barriers to cooperation can improve productivity and project \\noutcomes for all parties, particularly in complex, urban operational, community and \\nenvironmental settings. \\nIn addition  to the “hard” aspects of contractual incentives and risk allocation, less \\nadversarial contracting could be an important catalyst for transformation of the culture of \\nthe infrastructure industry towards greater cooperation among public and private sector \\nparticipants.\\n32 Australian Infrastructure Metric reports, Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, 2017 and 2018.30\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperative —Optimise performance management arrangements and introduce framework \\nagreements for infrastructure design and construction. Using a cross-government \\nperformance management scheme (with contractors and designers evaluated according \\nto their performance) can foster trust, while also building high performance and the right \\nbehaviours for sustainable project outcomes and constructor business performance. As \\nconfidence rises in the use of such a scheme, there are likely to be significant benefits to \\nindustry (removing fragmentation, building pipelines, improving talent retention, improving \\nprofitability) and for government in terms of improving delivery performance and outcomes. \\nFramework agreements can also drive improved performance and outcomes, and they \\ncould be used more frequently: the designers and contractors that perform could be \\nrewarded with additional projects over the longer term. Continuous process improvement \\ncould be built into framework arrangements with independent governance and \\nquantitative assessment, while open-book pricing could be a necessary component of \\nlonger-term framework agreements.\\n —Encourage competition by reforming the tender process and evaluation. When \\ncompetition is based purely on the price of an individual project, there is high risk that all \\nparties focus on low bid cost rather than innovation to optimise cost of the asset through \\nlife or end-customer benefits. Moreover, there is often low correlation between low bid \\ncost and cost at completion. Tender evaluation processes and criteria can be carefully \\ndesigned and implemented to get the best from the market, not just the cheapest. Some \\npotential shifts for discussion are offered in Exhibit 11. \\nExhibit 11\\nPotential ways of improving tender submission requirements and evaluation processes.\\nIdeas for improving tender submissions Ideas for improving tender evaluation\\n —Remove the requirement for any documentation that is \\nunnecessary for comparative evaluation.\\n —In allocating potential liabilities, consider excluding low \\nlikelihood but high financial consequence liabilities, \\nespecially those outside the contractor’s control.\\n —Minimise design requirements to those required to identify \\nvalue offered and enable pricing. Allow and encourage \\ninnovation and resilience through the delivery phase by \\nproviding design flexibility wherever practicable. —Include government performance management evaluation \\nfrom previous projects.\\n —Directly link the evaluation process to specific success \\ncriteria for the project.\\n —Make the evaluation criteria more transparent so bidders \\ncan confidently understand what the client values and \\noffer (only) this. This is particularly important where criteria \\n(including weightings) are in tension most specifically \\nbetween capex, whole-of-life (WOL) cost, and non-cost \\noutcomes (time, community, jobs, environmental impact).\\n —Risk-adjust prices and measure against the offered \\nvalue and potential changes during delivery, accepting \\nthat there will be contingent events where risk allocation \\ncannot be efficiently codified in advance and need flexible, \\ncollaborative responses when they occur. \\n —Consider reverse auction techniques such as selecting \\nthe second-lowest (risk- and value-adjusted) tender to \\nencourage industry to prepare high-value and low-price \\ntenders but not to take reckless positions through the \\ntender box price.31\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperative —Portfolio management. Within portfolios and potentially within individual megaprojects, \\noptimising package size, trade mix, and timing can improve access to market capacity \\nand foster effective, sustainable competition. Outcomes can be improved by thorough \\nsupply-chain management across the whole engineering and construction market \\n(including between infrastructure sectors—transport, utilities—and between the states) \\nas well as by fine-tuning timing so that industry can organise to compete effectively. A \\nnational infrastructure body such as Infrastructure Australia could develop a system to \\nmonitor portfolio-level activity at a more granular level and provide detailed information \\nto the states and delivery agencies to inform decision makers of capacity constraints \\nand to optimise timing. For example, there are likely to be times over the coming years \\nwhen engineering design demand peaks will benefit from timing shifts between projects \\nof several months to enable sufficient capacity. There have also been circumstances \\nin previous infrastructure booms when there has been spare capacity in “Tier 2” \\nconstruction companies while major companies have been at or beyond capacity; \\nunbundling projects in such circumstances may unlock additional market capacity and \\nimprove project outcomes.32\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperativeInnovative ways to address skills shortages and poor \\nconstruction productivity can drive a step change in \\nindustry performance.  \\nGiven the unprecedented scale, intensity, and complexity of Australia’s infrastructure \\ninvestment over the next five years, there will be immense pressure on public-sector \\nauthorities across the nation as well as other actors in the sector mandated to deliver their \\nrespective programs of work. A major factor in this will be the availability of suitably qualified \\ntalent. In this context, the skills-shortage issue has been well publicised (Exhibit 12). \\nWe analysed three possible forecast scenarios for construction employment demand based \\non the projected infrastructure spend:\\n —Worst-case scenario —construction productivity (measured as total workers employed \\nper Australian dollar spent) remains at 2018 levels.\\n —Conservative scenario —construction productivity levels return to the average \\nproductivity level from 2013–18.\\n —Productivity improvements scenario —construction productivity increases by \\n10\\xa0percent in five years from 2018 levels.\\nExhibit 12\\nSkill shortages have been well documented.\\nSOURCE: The Australian Financial Review, The Australian\\nInfrastructure boom runs short of engineers, electricians and steelSkills crisis at critical level: CEOs“Employers have warned Scott Morrison that the nation’s training system is ‘bedevilled by inconsistency’ and urgently needs ‘bolder reforms’ to tackle growing skills shortages that are threatening the delivery of an unprecedented pipeline of infrastructure projects.”8 August 2019\\n24 June 2019\\n“The unprecedented burst of infrastructure development across the eastern seaboard is creating shortages that frustrate employers and threaten delays in the completing the much-needed productivity boosts the country's largest cities desperately need.”Chapter 5: Enhancing \\nindustry capability \\nand capacity 33\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperativeDepending on the scenario  and based on high-level analysis, we estimate that Australia could \\npotentially need an additional 260 thousand – 385 thousand infrastructure construction \\nworkers over the coming years if the anticipated peak in infrastructure construction spend \\nis sustained. Even under the productivity improvements scenario, Australia may need to find \\n800,000 additional workers (through recruiting workers from adjacent industries, training \\nnew workers or migration) to meet a projected peak demand of 1.9 million (Exhibit 13).    \\nThe infrastructure sector in Australia will need additional capacity, the right skills, and the \\nright tools and processes to deliver a program at this scale, while ensuring mistakes from the \\npast are not repeated and value is returned to the general tax-paying public.\\nThree challenges with meeting the construction demand\\nWe see a number of unique challenges facing Australia in meeting the infrastructure \\ncapability gap in the years ahead:\\n1. The need is immediate. This challenge we face is not in the future—it is happening now. \\nAustralia is already on the delivery curve of new infrastructure investment so needs to \\nramp up capacity and capability in a way that enables the whole sector and value chain. \\nWe expect infrastructure spending nationwide to ramp up rapidly to 2020 and 2021, \\nincreasing the urgency of the challenge (Exhibit 14).\\n2. Mining construction is predicted to ramp up. While a downturn in the mining boom has \\ncreated a construction decline in the resources sector over the past five years, we expect \\nit to ramp up again over the next two years. For example, mining and heavy industry \\nconstruction in Western Australia is expected to grow at 10 percent per annum during \\n2019–23.33 This will create even more demand for construction and infrastructure workers \\nas many skills are fungible. \\n33 WA Infrastructure Report 2019 by CCA and CCF, BIS Oxford Economics ABS.Exhibit 13\\nAustralia  faces significant demand for additional resources for infrastructure construction. \\nSOURCE: ABS, IPAT, McKinsey analysis Historical employment Projected employment demand2.0\\n1.0\\n 0 1.5\\n 0.5 3.0 2.5\\n2013 1514 16 1817 19 20 21 22 23 20241.9m Peak demand in 2020\\n70%Incremental demand on 2018\\n800KAdditional need2.1m Peak demand in 2020\\n75%Incremental demand on 2018\\n880KAdditional need2.6m Peak demand in 2020\\n124%Incremental demand on 2018\\n1.5mAdditional need2018 actual productivity +10% productivity CAGR\\n2018 actual productivity \\nLast 5 years average productivity Estimated employment demand in construction sector\\nMillions\\n2018 employment: 1.17m\\nProductivity improvementsConservativeDownside casePreliminary High Level Estimate34\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperative3. Skilled migration is slowing. While Australia has historically experienced significant \\noverseas immigration intake relative to its population, skilled migration rates are expected \\nto slow. Recent policy decisions to reduce the annual intake of migrants by 15 percent and \\ntighten visa restrictions34 (reducing the cap from 190,000 to 160,000 from 2019 onwards) \\nwill make it harder for the infrastructure sector to employ migrants to mitigate workforce \\nshortages. In combination, these factors will lead to labour inflation if not addressed (see \\nsidebar “Labour inflation during the Australian mining boom”). As demand for labour \\nincreases with projected infrastructure spend, labour costs will increase unless supply \\nshortages are addressed.\\nLabour inflation during the Australian mining boom\\nIf not managed properly, skills shortages can increase the cost of infrastructure. \\nIn the decade to 2012, rising commodity prices led to a boom in the Australian resources \\nsector. During this time, mining companies struggled to recruit enough staff to meet \\ntheir needs. To address this skills shortage, mining companies offered higher wages to \\nattract workers from other sectors, interstate, and overseas. This increase in earnings \\neventually spread to other sectors of the economy and between 2003/04 and 2011/12, \\nreal wages in Australia increased by 17 percent.\\nThat said, during the mining boom companies could afford to pay more for labour as the \\ncost of hiring an additional worker was lower than the price of the output that the worker \\ncould help to produce. However, this is not the case for infrastructure, where wage \\ninflation could lead to cost blowouts and a rise in project costs across the board.\\nSource: RBA\\n34 Media release: A plan for Australia’s future population, Prime Minister of Australia , 20 March 2019,  \\nhttps://www.pm.gov.au/media/plan-australias-future-population.Exhibit 14\\nConstruction in the resources sector is expected to ramp up in the coming two years.\\n301060\\n020705040\\n1918 2013 14 15 16 17 20 21 22 2023\\nInfrastructure Mining, oil & gas\\nSOURCE: IPATInfrastructure spend per year\\nA$ Billions35\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperativeThree ways to bridge the capability and capacity gap\\nWe suggest that there are three key actions that infrastructure owners and delivery agencies \\ncan take to ensure sustainable industry capacity and capability in the years ahead: manage \\nboth the demand for workers and the supply.\\n — Improve talent retention by reframing the culture of the industry.  Externally and \\ninternally, the culture of the infrastructure construction industry is not viewed positively, \\nthereby making it difficult to attract and retain talent. An opportunity exists to reframe \\nand rebrand the industry, highlighting the positive societal impact of delivering and \\nmaintaining infrastructure, and the exciting technology opportunities presented by \\nnew digital technologies. New behaviours will be required across the industry, requiring \\nstakeholders across the public and private sector to embrace greater collaboration, with \\nless reliance on contract variations and a less litigious approach across the supply chain. \\nThere is opportunity for the work required to embed this change to be led across the \\nindustry, as well as within individual organisations.\\n —Managing the demand for workers can help fill the capacity gap. This means reducing \\nthe overall number of workers required to deliver the infrastructure program. We see three \\nmain levers to pull here: adopting new technologies to work more efficiently, reducing \\nprocess waste, and sequencing works more effectively. \\n• The sector can capitalise on automation opportunities in construction to simplify \\nprocesses and automate predictable work.  This could potentially affect 44 percent of \\nactivities within the sector.35\\n• The sector can manage labour demands by streamlining processes and eliminating \\nwork that doesn’t add value. Currently, infrastructure construction involves work \\nthat does not add value to final project outcomes. Examples include having multiple \\nconsortia completing different designs for the same project as part of the bidding \\nprocess, or rework due to errors or oversight. Streamlining these processes and \\nreducing error will shrink the work required.\\n• Agencies responsible for infrastructure can work together to sequence work, both \\nwithin states and across states. Effective sequencing of work can help to smooth \\ndemand for labour and avoid peaks followed by a sharp decline. Smoothing this work \\nover the next 10–20 years will contribute to mitigating labour shortages, while also \\ngiving engineering and construction (E&C) providers certainty over the pipeline.\\n —Managing the supply of workers will require both short-term and longer-term \\ninterventions.  In the short term, the infrastructure sector can manage supply through \\ncross-fertilisation with other sectors. Within the next months, agencies can draw on \\nconstruction expertise from the resources sector as mining construction experiences a \\ndownturn. This is an opportunity to recruit workers with expertise in managing the rapid \\nexpansion of capital works at scale. However, this will only offer a short-term solution, as \\nmining construction is expected to grow again from 2020 onwards.\\nIn the medium to long term, Australia can consider developing a nationwide infrastructure \\nsector skills strategy (see sidebar “The UK Transport Infrastructure Skills Strategy”).  \\nThis strategy would:\\n• Build a fact base around the skills, capabilities, and workforce numbers required to \\nsatisfy the infrastructure pipeline\\n• Understand the entry points at which people enter employment in the sector.\\n• Where shortages exist, identify sustainable strategies to meet the deficit, including: \\n »How to upskill the existing workforce\\n »How to harness mobility to meet shortages\\n »How to increase the talent pool and train the future workforce\\n »Ways to incentivise the private sector to invest to fill the gaps.\\n35 McKinsey Global Institute Global Automation Impact Model; McKinsey Global Institute analysis36\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperativeThe UK Transport Infrastructure Skills Strategy\\nIn recognition of the transport challenges facing the United Kingdom, in 2017 the UK \\nGovernment released a Transport Infrastructure Skills Strategy.1 The strategy defined \\nhow the country would develop the workforce required to support its record investment \\nin transport infrastructure. This included supporting jobs, skills, and apprenticeships; \\nmaximising productivity of the workforce; and strategies to attract students and \\nworkers to the sector.\\nThe UK has since established the Strategic Transport Apprenticeship Taskforce (STAT) \\nto drive the strategy recommendations. STAT is a cross-sector industry body that has \\nresponsibility for meeting targets for apprenticeships, sector diversity, and promoting \\ntransport as a career. It has established partnerships across the UK infrastructure \\nsector to implement the strategy.\\n1 https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transport-infrastructure-skills-strategy-two-years-on.\\nBy developing a national sector skills strategy, infrastructure agencies from different \\njurisdictions will be encouraged to work together to meet workforce requirements, rather than \\ncompete for the same workers. A key component of Australia’s infrastructure strategy would \\nneed to address training, including setting up “infrastructure academy” programs to develop \\nfuture workers, as well as relevant managers within government agencies (see sidebar “Best-\\npractice government agencies are investing to ensure their managers are equipped with the \\nrequisite know-how”).\\nBest-practice government agencies are investing to ensure their \\nmanagers are equipped with the requisite know-how\\nManagement skills are crucial to the success of any government program. A study by \\nMcKinsey and Oxford University revealed that more than two-thirds of budget overruns \\nin large-scale projects are due to managerial—not technical—shortcomings. \\nBest-practice government agencies are investing to make sure their managers are \\nequipped with the requisite know-how. The US Office of Multifamily Housing Programs, \\nan agency of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, recently undertook \\na capability-building program that included a series of process improvements, the \\nintroduction of new managerial routines, and intensive coaching on problem-solving \\nskills. The program yielded a reduction of more than 70 percent in the agency’s backlog \\nof housing applications and a 35 percent productivity improvement. When Germany’s \\nFederal Labour Agency undertook a similar program, the agency’s “customers” \\nbenefited: their average duration of unemployment fell from 164 days to 136 days. The \\nSwedish Migration Board’s capability-building efforts led to a reduction in average \\nprocessing times from 267 days to 85 days, saving more than $160 million annually.37\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperativeTechnology presents the biggest opportunity to boost \\nproductivity in construction, and there are several steps that \\nthe private and public sectors can take to lead the sector into \\nthe digital era.\\nGlobally, construction is probably the least reliable economic activity, with 98 percent of \\nprojects incurring cost or schedule overruns. A survey of large capital investment projects by \\nnotable companies in mining, oil and gas, and infrastructure shows that:36\\n —Average cost increase is 80 percent of original value\\n —Average slippage is 20 months behind original schedule.\\nAt the same time, lagging labour productivity is a key source of construction challenges \\n(Exhibit 15) globally: labour-productivity growth in construction has averaged only 1 percent \\na year over the past two decades, compared with growth of 2.8 percent for the total world \\neconomy and 3.6 percent in the case of manufacturing.37 Meanwhile, Australian Bureau \\nof Statistics data38 indicate that productivity growth in the Australian construction sector \\nhas begun to drop off in the past few years, potentially driven by increased demand and \\nassociated market capacity and capability challenges.\\n36 HIS Herold Global Projects database (Nov 19 2013), Companies public annual reports, press releases.\\n37 McKinsey Global Institute Re-inventing construction.\\n38 Australian Bureau of Statistics - https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/5260.0.55.004.Chapter 6: Boosting \\nproductivity in project \\ndelivery through technology\\nExhibit 15\\nGlobally, lagging labor productivity is a key source of construction challenges.\\n10080120160140180200\\n1995 2000 05 10 2014 1.02.73.6\\n$25 $37 $39\\n1.

These practices remain as important as ever and \\nare fundamental to all efforts in boosting construction productivity. \\nHowever, such practices alone have not proven enough. The construction sector will need to \\nincrease adoption of technology innovations to make the step change necessary to bridge its \\nproductivity gap—McKinsey research indicates that technology is the most promising lever \\nfor improving construction productivity, with approximately a 15 percent impact. Construction \\ntechnology (“contech”) and E&C technology solutions are attracting growing funding globally; \\noverall investment has grown by some 200 percent over the past six years (Exhibit 16). \\nMoreover, the contech space in Australia is also very vibrant, accounting for 8.9 percent40 of \\ntotal venture capital investment in Australia since 2016 (Exhibit 17).

The “digital twins” approach represents an extension of the use of \\n5-D building information modelling (BIM) concepts to advance from a traditional design \\nto a live digital update of as-built progress. Digital twin applications utilise an integration \\nof 3-D models generated by drone imagery and other reality-capture technologies such \\nas satellite imagery and LiDAR, combined with live key performance indicators that are \\nmonitored using IoT sensors. This creates an exact digital replica of a project’s physical \\nreality, allowing users to incorporate as-built data into 3-D models for automated, real-\\ntime progress updates, while facilitating virtual site inspections that utilise mixed reality \\nto combine 3-D design with as-built configurations. This improves safety by reducing \\nphysical presence on site, improves connectivity between site and office, and reduces \\ntime in decision-making cycles in schedule and budgeting to shift from monthly reviews \\nto\\xa0daily optimisation. \\n39 Reinventing construction: A route to higher productivity, McKinsey Global Institute,  February 2017, McKinsey.com.\\n40 Digital Foundations, How Technology is Transforming Australia’s Construction Sector, StartupAus  report39\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperativeExhibit 17\\nThe Australian construction technology ecosystem is active with a growing range of solutions \\nbeing developed.\\nSOURCE: StartupAus report on Digital Foundations, How Technology is Transforming Australia’s Construction Sector Field OfficeTeam\\nExhibit 16\\nInvestment in constructiontech has grown by some 200 percent globally.\\n9,172\\n2\\n7,61818,446Time period\\n1,1549082461,191\\n18,4464051\\n,780\\n3,4198,3792,1531,119Bankruptcy\\nEarly Stage VCDebtOther\\nLate Stage VC                  M&APEIPOTotal\\n6246108614217908 $15.7b50Spend\\nIn US $ Millions# of trans.Investment—over time and by type\\nTotal2013–182008–12SpendIn US $ Millions# of trans.40\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperative —Use of artificial intelligence and advanced analytics in design and schedule \\noptimisation. In the long-term, AI and analytics have numerous potential use cases in \\nE&C. A few examples we currently see include using machine learning and reality capture \\nto compare in situ field conditions with plans; optimising schedules to sequence tasks and \\nhit target deadlines and provide real-time guidance on divergences from blueprints to \\npredict and correct issues; and in the longer-term, data input of multiple separate design \\npackages that could feed into an AI design program to select the appropriate design.\\n —Use of technology in contract assurance.  We have seen companies save up to \\n16\\xa0percent on contract cost, in terms of measurement and verification, with the use \\nof drones. This approach saved on labour, but also on daily interest payments, as this \\napproach involved less working capital for cheaper up-front price. \\n —Use of drones and IoT to improve safety outcomes on site.  Examples include real-time \\nmonitoring of hazards with alerts (such as a labourer walking beneath a crane) together \\nwith transparency into whether the site is being built to an adequate safety standard.\\n —Use of digital tools in performance management and in establishing a project \\nproduction system. Standardisation of work on site can improve cost and time \\nperformance, increase senior management visibility, and reduce instances of project \\n“blow-outs” such as delays and budget overruns. These principles, contained within lean \\nmanufacturing, can be further enhanced with digital construction techniques across four \\nmain areas: using IoT to collect data on all man and equipment movements to provide full \\nvisibility of progress and optimise efficiency; utilising a “digital control tower” to monitor \\nreal-time performance management; use of on-site robotics (for example, employing \\nautonomous vehicles to standardise repetitive tasks); and harnessing remote connectivity \\nto facilitate better information flow (for example, a virtual site walk-through in current, \\nas-built condition).\\n —Using modularisation, off-site manufacturing, and machinery to create a \\nmanufacturing-based approach to construction. Parts of the construction industry are \\nmoving toward a manufacturing-like system of mass production, relying on prefabricated, \\nstandardised components that are produced off-site. While this is less applicable \\nin transport infrastructure, relative to real estate, given the inherently lower level of \\nhomogeneity in the product, there are some applications within transport infrastructure \\n(for instance, deck-laying machines called launch girders used for constructing Dubai \\nMetro’s pre-cast and modular viaduct segments in place, on top of pre-cast piers and \\npier heads) as well as many applications in construction of related areas of transport \\ninfrastructure (such as airport terminals and rail passenger stations). Our research finds \\nthat consistent use of these techniques, on projects where they are economically feasible, \\ncould boost the sector’s productivity substantially. Example use cases include:\\n• Construction robotics such as bricklaying or welding robots, similar to self-driving heavy \\nmachinery in mines to make construction safer, faster, and more affordable \\n• Off-site prefabrication of modular elements, or complex re-bar fabrication to turn a 3-D \\nmodel into a prefabricated building component—recent modular projects have already \\nestablished a solid track record of accelerating project timelines by 20 to 50 percent41\\n• The use of exoskeletons and wearable robotics to harness the strength of robotic arms \\n• 3-D printing of long-lead components such as joints.\\n41 Modular construction: From projects to products, McKinsey & Company , June 2019, https://www.mckinsey.com/\\nindustries/capital-projects-and-infrastructure/our-insights/modular-construction-from-projects-to-products.41\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperativeThere are six things government authorities can consider going \\nforward to lead infrastructure construction and delivery into the \\ndigital era \\nIn this context, project sponsors will play a critical role in enabling technology adoption by the \\nsector. Here are the six things Australian authorities can do to lead infrastructure construction \\ninto the digital era:42\\n —Collect and “own” data —big data is a significant enabler for digitisation; authorities can \\naccess and collect data about end users and customers.\\n —Set bold aspirations —at the outset, governments can articulate bold aspirations for the \\nadoption and use of technology in public-sector projects; beyond increasing awareness, \\nsuch public aspirations demonstrate the priority given to developing a more efficient \\nconstruction industry through broader deployment of new technologies.\\n —Create meaningful incentives —governments can also use financial resources and \\ntendering processes to create meaningful incentives for construction companies; for \\nexample, public grants could be offered to help companies adopt technologies that aid \\nin-project design and execution. Further, public contracting agencies can insist that \\nsuccessful bidders incorporate digital collaboration tools into publicly owned projects. For \\nexample, the Tennessee Department of Transportation recently announced it will require \\nprime contractors and designers to use construction productivity software on all its \\nprojects, beginning with March 2019 contract awards.\\n —Manage risk —in addition to creating meaningful incentives to spur adoption, \\ngovernments can help reduce the barriers and risks that are unique to these emerging \\ntechnologies; for example, procurement or acquisition regulations often place significant \\nemphasis on a contractor’s past performance in future source selections.\\n —Ensure transparency —measures to increase transparency around costs and progress of \\npublic projects can be enhanced by digital technologies that provide real-time progress \\ninformation; in turn, increased transparency creates pressure to complete projects on \\nbudget and on time, and this becomes easier when new technologies are deployed.\\n —Build capabilities —as with most industries, the construction sector will struggle to \\nfind the talent needed to use new technologies effectively, but governments can play \\na dual role in helping to meet this challenge: investing in training programs not only \\nbuilds needed capabilities but also provides new opportunities to workers displaced by \\nthese\\xa0technologies.\\n42 Governments can lead construction into the digital era, McKinsey & Company , April 2019, https://www.mckinsey.com/\\nindustries/capital-projects-and-infrastructure/our-insights/governments-can-lead-construction-into-the-digital-era.42\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperative\\nIn this report, we have purposefully described the challenges and opportunities for the \\ninfrastructure sector as a whole. However, we recognise that each stakeholder group has \\nthe ability to influence different elements of the infrastructure planning, design, and delivery \\nvalue chain. Below we set out our thoughts on some of the key takeaways and initiatives for \\ngovernment, investors, and contractors. \\nGovernment. The Commonwealth, state, and local governments are the ultimate funders \\nof public infrastructure and accountable to residents for timely, effective, and affordable \\nprovision. They also set the policy, legal, and regulatory framework within which investors \\nand contractors operate. Given the scale of Australia’s infrastructure portfolio and the size \\nof the gap, governments face a huge challenge as they integrate across the various industry \\nstakeholders to deliver infrastructure on time and to budget. To address these challenges, \\nwe believe there are a number of areas where government can consider innovation options to \\nlead Australia’s infrastructure agenda: \\n —Publish an integrated vision for how technology will shape the way that people and \\nfreight move around a city. This will involve making purposeful choices around Australia’s \\nfuture target state in relation to mobility, smart cities, and the implications of automation. \\nFor such a vision to be practical, it will need to capture and articulate the implications of \\nthese trends and resulting choices for the allocation of capital by asset class/mode (for \\ninstance, rail versus road) and investment category (mandatory versus discretionary, \\nfurther subdivided into strategic, capacity expansion, or provision of additional \\npopulation coverage). We should note that this approach requires a more holistic view of \\ninfrastructure provision. \\n —Identify and address the major policy enablers and barriers to the adoption of \\ninfrastructure innovations. The most difficult aspect of this will be to manage the \\ntransition towards the future state enshrined in the vision. For example, one of the primary \\nrate-limiting factors in the adoption of autonomous vehicles will be how laws adapt to \\nreflect inherent risks (such as responsibility for fatal accidents). Another example, in the \\ncontext of smart cities, is how well residents’ data privacy concerns are addressed and \\nto ensure they do not feel that big business is taking advantage of them. In certain cases, \\ngovernment will need to set standards that mandate the adoption of technologies in the \\ndelivery of major infrastructure assets—for example, 5D BIM.\\n —Rethink the way projects are prioritised and selected. This will involve developing \\nthe capability to perform rapid options analysis, while reorienting formal business-case \\nanalysis to avoid simplifying projects to single (potentially misleading) metrics, and to \\nfocus on scenarios that take future disruptions into account. It will also involve applying \\nbehavioural science to debias decision making, for example through conducting robust \\npre-mortems and encouraging diversity of thought.\\n —Promote the development of capabilities within the “owner’s team”. Government \\ncan consider how to develop the necessary internal capabilities to manage the portfolio \\nof infrastructure megaprojects through their lifecycle. This is a non-delegable set of \\ncapabilities driven by government’s unique position as the integrator and ultimate owner \\nof all risk (regardless of contractual mechanisms). It will include working with industry to \\nconduct an iterative, collaborative design-to-value process for all projects, adopting an \\nagile approach.Takeaways for key \\nstakeholder groups43\\nAustralia’s infrastructure innovation imperative\\n —Build industry capability, capacity, and competition.  This will involve moving away from \\ntraditional contracting, risk transfer, and tendering models to create the conditions for \\nnew market entrants. It will also mean adopting innovative practices such as collaborative \\ncontracting and potentially even setting up panels of qualified contractors to enable \\nlonger-term private-sector investment in capability development. Agencies responsible \\nfor infrastructure can work together to sequence work, both within and across states, \\nhelping to mitigate labour shortages while also offering contractors more certainty \\nover the pipeline. To address short-term skills shortages, governments could draw on \\nunderutilised construction expertise from the resources sector. In the longer term, \\ngovernments should consider developing a national sector skills strategy and identify \\nsustainable strategies to address the deficit.\\nInvestors (private and public sector).  In recent years, investors have competed down \\ninfrastructure asset yields as they seek long-term homes for capital. Now, however, they \\nface huge uncertainty as disruptive technologies (for example, autonomous vehicles) \\nrender traditional investment cases and contracting models (such as 30-year concessions) \\ninadequate—especially where demand risk is taken into account. Investors can consider how to:\\n —Apply design-to-value using an agile approach. Investors (both government and private \\ninstitutions) are in a unique position to bring together owners/developers, designers, \\nand builders of infrastructure megaprojects to fundamentally reform traditional value-\\nengineering approaches. By convening collaborative, multidisciplinary agile teams of \\ndedicated professionals (“squads”), driving at pace through a series of sprints to rapidly \\niterate the design, investors can force trade-off decisions and significantly improve return \\non capital. \\n —Actively assess the impact of disruptive trends on infrastructure demands and \\nusage. This will involve building an assessment of real-world future scenarios into the \\ninvestment assessment and prioritisation process, these scenarios being based on the \\nevolution of disruptive trends such as the future of mobility, smart cities, and automation.\\n —Proactively consider investing in new asset classes created by technology.  There \\nis high demand for potentially attractive new asset classes created by infrastructure \\ntechnology trends. Examples include electric vehicle charging points and smart-city \\nsensor networks. Investors able to understand the fundamentals and “tipping points” \\nfor these new asset classes will achieve a substantial first-mover advantage and \\ndeliver\\xa0outperformance.\\nContractors. While contractors have the potential to benefit from unprecedented demand, \\nthey currently face the very real prospect of a “profitless boom” caused by high transaction \\ncosts, staff churn, industry fragmentation, productivity stagnation, increased contractual and \\ntechnical risk, and challenges in accessing skilled labour. There is a huge prize for those that \\ncan crack the productivity challenge and act as a thought partner to government. Aspects to \\nconsider include:\\n —Championing innovations to create a step-change in productivity. Given the scale \\nof private infrastructure investment, Australian contractors have the opportunity to lead \\nthe world in productivity improvements driven by technology. This will require them to \\nset a technology vision and aspiration that supports their productivity ambitions; identify \\nand quantify the technology “use cases” to unlock value; and commit to a roadmap that \\nbalances meaningful investment in core enablers (such as data analytics and multi-speed \\nIT) with a phased approach that builds confidence. Capturing this potential will also \\nrequire an intensive focus on non-technology disciplines (for example, lean construction) \\nto ensure change is achieved in the front line.\\n —Invest in required skills and competencies.

Our members also recognise the importance of Melbourne and Australia being at the forefront of the development, adoption and deployment of AI. With the sustained level of investment being made  in AI, the pace of advances will continue  to accelerate.AI has made it easier and more efficient for consumers to make online purchases and to connect with friends and family via online applications. Businesses can be made more  efficient and profitable through the use of technology underpinned by AI, in order to better target products and services and improve their operations. Research and development can be greatly enhanced through the application of AI, such as effective data analysis and research trials. The community benefits from AI applications that improve the delivery of health, education and insurance services.Melbourne’s economic prosperity and growth is linked to the success of particular sectors, such as: health; supply chain logistics; advanced manufacturing; education; research; and the experience economy – all of which can be underpinned by effective use of AI. The Australian Government has recognised that sectors such as natural resources and environment; health, ageing and disability; and cities, towns and infrastructure will benefit from a strategic approach to AI. AI will underpin innovation and research, drive growth  and accelerate proficiencies in these sectors  into the future.The proliferation of AI applications in our lives is already raising questions about data and privacy, security and human rights. Higher internet speeds and further miniaturisation of massive computing power and memory / storage will further enable AI applications to be better connected, predictive, distributed and ubiquitous.   Foreword11The\\tfuture\\tof\\tArtificial\\tIntelligence\\t(AI)\\tin\\tAustralia\\t|\\t5\\nWhilst we discover more innovative applications for AI, we must ensure that we consider the ethical, social and human implications of deployment, and that our regulatory and legal systems at least keep pace with the challenges, or – even better – anticipate them.This is especially true when AI is deployed in systems and processes which critically underpin community trust and well-being. These systems need an ethical framework within which to operate, with a special emphasis on harm minimisation. Furthermore, such systems need to be able to rapidly identify, rectify and remediate problems,  and the accountability for achieving desired outcomes also needs to be clearly defined.Collaboration between government and the  private sector will be essential to ensure that required protections are in place for the benefit  of the community.Committee for Melbourne’s AI Taskforce has identified in this report the key stakeholder collaboration mechanisms and governance frameworks for the ethical development,  adoption and deployment of AI.The Victorian All-Party Parliamentary Group on AI has already been established and should be re-convened. The establishment of an AI hub would also enable greater networks and collaboration across Greater Melbourne and potentially also facilitate pilot programs that could test and implement future AI initiatives.In June, the Victorian Government committed $1.5 million to fund the establishment of an accelerator and investment fund for AI scaleups. This is an important initiative which recognises that startups in AI need particular support. Backed by LaunchVic, Boab AI (in partnership with Artesian), Victorian universities and Artesian’s international partner programs, the new accelerator will help AI scaleups access much needed private sector capital. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses, jobs, society and the community has created a generational challenge. We are being compelled to do new things at speed. AI will have numerous critical roles to play on our road to recovery. As such, the initiatives outlined in this report are more important than ever and warrant urgent consideration.We trust that the recommendations in this report and continued collaboration between the public and private sector will enable Melbourne to play a leading role in promoting the ethical application of  AI for Australia and other parts of the world.       Scott Tanner  Martine Letts Chair,    CEO, Committee  Committee for Melbourne  for Melbourne\\nForeword6 | Committee for Melbourne\\nFrom\\tthe\\tparticipants2\\n“ Developments in AI present great opportunities to deliver innovative and more efficient solutions and services for our community. We need to put in place an appropriate governance framework so that the use of artificial intelligence meets community expectations for fairness and transparency, while also allowing us to unlock the benefits of AI.”“ Australia’s well known focus on good governance and robust leadership has placed the country in a good position to develop future technologies that need to be trusted, for example in areas like financial services, government and health sectors. However, a balance must be struck, to enable the exploitation of AI for the benefit of society, while demonstrating the right protections for society. It is pleasing to see that this is already happening, and the Committee for Melbourne demonstrates thought leadership in this report which aims to strike that balance.”  “ As commercial interests accelerate the development of digital technology, there are opportunities to leverage AI to improve the life chances of citizens. The biggest areas of application are in improving people’s health and wellbeing; optimising the allocation of resources, particularly in a crisis; and augmenting people’s capability to deliver essential services. The technology is available now and requires focused and purposeful leadership to translate into operational capability.”2\\nRichard Spurio  Managing Partner, Allens Rob Hillard Chief Strategy & Innovation Officer, Deloitte\\nGavin Seewooruttun  Partner and Asia-Pacific Advisory Leader for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Analytics, EYThe future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Australia | 7\\n“ At Jacobs, our objective is to make the world smarter, more connected, and more sustainable, so we are delighted to apply our vision to the future of the country’s AI infrastructure. Australia and Victoria have an opportunity to play a leading role in the development and application of AI to help improve the way we understand and solve the most important issues facing our community. Through considered policy, investment, and practical application we are realising a broader range of AI-derived improvements to help make a real difference in the lives of Victorian families.”   “ Adoption of AI technology has accelerated rapidly with the potential for significant societal change, with AI-driven benefits for consumers, businesses, governments and communities. This valuable report highlights the opportunity for continued dialogue around the need for investment and leadership in AI technology innovation with the ability to attract and train a new workforce, balanced with a societal discussion around ethics, privacy and AI for social good.” “ The power of AI is transformative for our society. As it becomes a greater part of our lives we have to make sure that it strengthens the rights and interests of all of us as human beings.” “ ‘With great power comes great responsibility’.   First stated over 200 years ago and restated famously by Winston Churchill and more recently Ben Parker (Spiderman’s uncle), this quote is relevant when considering Artificial Intelligence (AI).  I have been using AI to solve my clients’ problems for over twenty years. I’ve seen the evidence of how it frequently and increasingly empowers businesses in all industries. It’s now time to formalise considerations relating to the increased responsibility that comes with this increased power, which is what this report’s recommendations are for. As businesses use AI to improve productivity, reduce risk and operating costs, and when promoting rapid innovation governments can assist them to adequately consider the risks associated with AI implementation. Risk mitigation requires AI is developed, deployed, governed, operated, and maintained in a responsible fashion. We are very proud to have contributed to this report.” “ AI has quickly embedded itself to the core of innovation, creating economic and social benefits in a wide variety of sectors. However, as AI continues to have a greater impact on all aspects of society, challenges associated with the use of AI technologies also increase. This is why it’s critical for organisations at the forefront of these changes to come together and lead the discussion on how to meet the challenges while making the best possible use of the benefits that AI can bring  in a thoughtful, considerate manner.”From the participantsFrom the participants\\nPatrick Hill Senior Vice President, Jacobs Professor Matt Kuperholz  Chief Data Scientist and Partner, Analytics, PwC\\nProfessor Joanna Batstone  Director of the Monash Data Futures Institute, Monash University \\nTim Orton  Managing Director, Nous GroupSami Mäkeläinen Technology Insights Principal, Telstra8 | Committee for Melbourne\\nContributors3\\nAbout Committee for Melbourne\\nCommittee for Melbourne (Committee)  is an apolitical, not-for-profit, member-based entity that brings together  over 150 organisations from Greater Melbourne’s business, academic and  civic sectors, who share a common vision to make Melbourne a better place to live, work and do business.As an independent organisation we represent no single interest group or political position, but seek to challenge conventional thinking and to develop innovative ideas to continue to enhance  our position as an economically  prosperous and highly liveable  global city.Our thanksThe Committee would like to express its appreciation to our member organisations who helped contribute to the development of this report. 3\\nThe\\tfuture\\tof\\tArtificial\\tIntelligence\\t(AI)\\tin\\tAustralia\\t|\\t9\\nContributors\\nAI Taskforce Steering CommitteeTo assist with development of actions in this  space, a Committee for Melbourne AI Taskforce was established, led by a Steering Committee of industry leaders from a broad range of sectors, and chaired by the Committee’s Chair, Scott Tanner (Chair, Committee for Melbourne). The Taskforce and Steering Committee were drawn from the Committee’s cross sectorial membership from various industries, including technology, finance, infrastructure, housing associations, developers, legal, academia and consulting firms. Each sector leader brought unique methods and ideas to contribute to the report based on their expertise. The Steering Committee was made up of contributors including: Allens, Commonwealth Bank, CSIRO’s Data61, EY , Deloitte, Jacobs, Monash University, Nous Group, PwC and Telstra. This report has also been produced with the assistance of representatives from Committee for Melbourne’s Secretariat, including Leanne Edwards, Director of Policy & Research. Disclaimer Please note, the views in this publication reflect the synthesis of the Committee’s diverse and cross-sectorial membership. All material expresses a merging of these differing perspectives and the concepts presented in this report should not be attributed to any individual member organisation.Victorian All-Party Parliamentary Group on Artificial Intelligence (VAPPGAI) With assistance and advocacy from the Committee, members of the Victorian Parliament established an All-Party Parliamentary Group on Artificial Intelligence (VAPPGAI) in 2018 to learn more about AI and the impact it will have on Victorians in the future. Meetings held by this group, as well as the Committee for Melbourne’s AI Summit on the 27 October 2019, have started the discussion and education required towards finding the mechanisms to manage and make the most of AI innovation. The Committee’s AI report will be delivered to VAPPGAI, governments at all levels and broader community stakeholder groups, to continue  the discussion and encourage practical  actions and outcomes.The Committee has commenced discussions  with the Federal Government, in the hopes that  an Australian All-Party Parliamentary Group on Artificial Intelligence (AAPPGAI) might be established, with the same aim across the country.Contributors10 | Committee for Melbourne\\nIn September 2016, the Committee launched its Melbourne 4.0 strategy to help prepare Greater Melbourne for the accelerating speed of innovation and disruption that has catapulted us to the early stages of the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’. The Committee’s Melbourne 4.0 project makes it clear that if we keep progressing with ‘business as usual’, the future of our city may not be all that bright. The Committee therefore identified nine strategic needs that we must address if  we are serious about underpinning a liveable and flourishing Greater  Melbourne in the future. \\nTwo of the strategic needs identified were ‘digital capability’ and ‘competitive internet’ and how to prepare Greater Melbourne and Victoria for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. Artificial Intelligence (AI) was considered to be the key issue in the context of the digital capability and increasing technological requirements of our community. AI is arguably one of the most important technological issues facing us in the future. AI offers many benefits and opportunities, as well as many challenges – we now need a prominent and informed public debate about AI in Victoria.This report considers eight key areas, highlights the trends and activities and makes recommendations for action by government, business and stakeholders. The eight key areas in this report are:• Data • Governance • Equity and Equality  • Skills • Trade • Infrastructure • Entrepreneurship and Innovation • SecurityThere is a great deal of work being done on all questions related to AI across Australia and overseas. Accordingly, this report takes into account work being done in Australia and overseas and provides a series of recommendations for the community, industry and government as a practical contribution to resolving the challenges faced in Greater Melbourne as a result of the use of AI.Purpose of this report:  This report aims to provide education, information and recommendations for action under each of the eight key areas highlighted above to ensure a balance is struck between regulating to protect human rights, equity and equality and allowing innovation to occur so that society as a whole is able to benefit from the outcomes  of AI. Purpose of this report\\nPurpose\\tof\\t this\\treport\\n?4The\\tfuture\\tof\\tArtificial\\tIntelligence\\t(AI)\\tin\\tAustralia\\t|\\t11\\nIntroduction to Artificial Intelligence\\nIntroduction\\t to\\tArtificial\\t Intelligence\\nThere is no commonly agreed definition of Artificial Intelligence (AI), but the definition identified by the Australian Government in its AI roadmap in November 2019 titled Artificial Intelligence: Solving problems, growing the economy and improving our quality of life (Commonwealth Government Roadmap) was:\\n “ Artificial intelligence (AI) may be defined as a collection of interrelated technologies used to solve problems autonomously and perform tasks to achieve defined objectives, in some cases without explicit guidance from a human being. Subfields of AI include machine learning, computer vision, human language technologies, robotics, knowledge representation and other scientific fields.  The power of AI comes from a convergence of technologies.” \\n1\\nAI applications can be broadly classified into two categories based on their purpose, enabling Augmented Intelligence or Autonomous Intelligence.•  Augmented Intelligence: Augmented Intelligence, as defined by Gartner, is a design pattern for a human-centred partnership model of people and AI working together to enhance cognitive performance, including learning, decision making and new experiences. Essentially, Augmented Intelligence applications would involve a human as part of the action or decision-making chain where the AI system provides the information required to enable the decision. For instance, an AI algorithm can analyse a patient’s symptoms and vital signs, compare it with the history of the patient, her family and those other patients it has in store, and give her doctor suggested diagnoses for him to decide upon. Siri and the Google assistant are forms of AI that fall into this category.2\\n•  Autonomous Intelligence: Autonomous systems operate in complex and open-ended environments with high levels of independence and self-determination. For instance, unmanned or self-driving vehicles, autopilot systems in aeroplanes and drone-based delivery systems are AI systems that fall into this category. Such systems differ from Augmented Intelligence systems due to the fact that they can make a decision and execute on it without requiring a human in the loop.\\n3\\n1  Hajkowicz SA1+, Karimi S1, Wark T1, Chen C1, Evans M1, Rens N3, Dawson D1, Charlton A2, Brennan T2, Moffatt C2, Srikumar S2, Tong KJ2 (2019).

The VAPPGAI Primer highlighted that there are many uses and benefits that have been delivered from  AI for the community. For example:•  Consumers are more readily able to purchase goods and services online, make travel bookings, access news and information and connect with friends and family through social media. •  Businesses are able to understand consumers’ preferences and deliver on their needs with greater understanding, accuracy and efficiency. •  Governments are using AI to provide services, research policies and to campaign and advertise  to voters. •  Community benefits in many sectors such as health, education, insurance and retail have been derived from the use of AI.There are a range of sectors that have benefitted from AI. As the EU describes: “ AI technologies can be extremely beneficial from an economic and social point of view and are already being used in areas such as healthcare (for instance, to find effective treatments for cancer) and transport (for instance, to predict traffic conditions and guide autonomous vehicles), or to efficiently manage energy and water consumption. AI increasingly affects our daily lives, and its potential range of application is so broad that it is sometimes referred to as the fourth industrial revolution.” \\n4\\nHowever, there are also a number of potential issues and risks that arise from the use of AI, such as ethical, legal and economic concerns. Therefore, a balance needs to be struck to ensure these concerns can be dealt with, while ensuring that the benefits outlined above can be achieved for the whole of society.The VAPPGAI Primer highlights that AI is developing exponentially and that: \\n “ We can expect massive advances in AI in the near future – making it hard to predict where AI might take us in the short to medium term, let alone long term.”The pace of innovation in AI, and use of AI, has been accelerating faster than the ability of governments to understand and regulate its development and use. Accordingly, there are concerns about how AI could be used to breach the rights of individuals (such as to facilitate mass data collection or surveillance), be applied for anti-competitive practices and undermine democratic processes (amongst many potential concerns). The threat of jobs losses and skills shortages due to lagging education programs are also of concern. It is important to note that the risk of ‘bias’ associated with the use of AI, resulting from a variety of factors including bias in data inputs, is also a considerable challenge being faced.The capacity to benefit from, and adapt to, the challenges and opportunities presented by AI is one of the major strategic issues facing Victoria and Australia. Already many countries around the world are considering ways of meeting the challenges of AI. As outlined in the Commonwealth Government’s Discussion Paper, ‘Artificial Intelligence, Australia’s Ethics Framework’\\n5, CSIRO Data 61’s analysis reveals that over the past few years, 14 countries and international organisations have announced AU$86 billion for AI programs looking at the ethical issues associated with AI development (as depicted in the infographic below from the same Discussion Paper).\\n4  Tambiama Madiega, EU Guidelines on Ethics in Artificial Intelligence: context and implementation, EU Briefing, European Parliamentary Research Service, Members’ Research Service, PE 640.163 – September 2019 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=EPRS_BRI(2019)640163 (accessed 3 February 2020): EPRS briefing on Economic impacts of artificial intelligence  by Marcin Szczepański, July 2019.\\n5  Dawson D and Schleiger E*, Horton J, McLaughlin J, Robinson C∞, Quezada G, Scowcroft J, and Hajkowicz S† (2019) Artificial Intelligence: Australia’s Ethics Framework.

The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) also published a Guide to Data Analytics and Australian Privacy Principles in 2018. \\nThe Commonwealth Government has a significant role in the following areas:•  development and enforcement of appropriate  laws regulating the use of AI•  adopting or defining standards and frameworks for the use of AI (including assigning responsibility)• information sharing•  providing incentives and support for development of AI initiatives •  ensuring a pipeline of talent is attracted to and retained in AustraliaThere are a number of recommendations for the Commonwealth in this report, including the establishment of a National Centre of AI Ethics and Innovation (NCAIEI). Such a body might have significant roles, including to: develop policy, technical standards, codes of practice and frameworks; drive strategy and initiatives; and provide technical support or guidance to regulators in enforcing laws where there is AI involvement (such as privacy, discrimination, competition and corporate misconduct) as well as information where trends are changing in the industry. The NCAIEI should proactively engage with business, government and technology firms to establish consistent guidelines that help define the roles  and responsibilities of the AI industry generally and also any organisations involved in developing, testing and using AI, including promoting fair, transparent, explainable and secure use of AI in a manner that is consistent with appropriate ethical considerations and community expectations. The NCAIEI should be instructed to take a measured approach that balances technological progress and commercial interests with the importance of embedding human rights and ethical decision-making as the norms in the development and use of AI algorithms across the private and public sectors. \\n6 Hajkowicz SA1+, Karimi S1, Wark T1, Chen C1, Evans M1, Rens N3, Dawson D1, Charlton A2, Brennan T2, Moffatt C2, Srikumar S2, Tong KJ2 (2019)  Artificial intelligence: Solving problems, growing the economy and improving our quality of life. CSIRO Data61, Australia.Key recommendations for the Commonwealth Government in AI6The\\tfuture\\tof\\tArtificial\\tIntelligence\\t(AI)\\tin\\tAustralia\\t|\\t17\\nSummary of key recommendations\\nAt present, existing laws and governance frameworks are either not in place or not fit-for-purpose for AI. Although contract law, tort law, discrimination law and consumer protection laws may have some application in specific circumstances, there is uncertainty surrounding the extent of their application. At best, current laws indirectly regulate the use of AI by regulating the uses of information as an input to AI systems through privacy and data protection laws. Accordingly, the Commonwealth Government (through the Federal Parliament) must also propose appropriate and balanced legislative reforms to areas of the law affected by AI, such as privacy, discrimination, competition and corporations laws. However, any changes to these legislative frameworks to apply them to AI will require careful consideration of what amendments should be  made to achieve the desired protections. Due to Australia’s federal system of laws, some of this legislative change will need to be undertaken at  a state level and some reforms will need to occur  at a Commonwealth level. However, it is important that these changes are consistent.The Commonwealth Government must also equip the existing regulators in these areas to enforce these new laws – and to ensure that these regulators have the ability to enforce these new laws in the context of AI. This would require that these regulators have the necessary understanding of  AI technologies and capabilities, whether as an internal resource or available to them externally.  This might include the provision of technical support or guidance from the NCAIEI. As a separate body, an ‘AI Ombudsman’ could  act as an independent complaints resolution  service for the public on AI related issues.The Commonwealth also has a role in sharing information and educating the community,  including government, businesses, academia  and other stakeholders about the importance,  uses and trends of AI. In order to be nimble and able to respond to that information, a bi-partisan approach may be needed. Accordingly, just as the Victorian Parliament has established the VAPPGAI, an Australian All-Party Parliamentary Group on Artificial Intelligence (AAPPGAI) might be  established to achieve those aims.The key recommendations and more detailed supporting recommendations for the Commonwealth Government are summarised  in the tables below.18 | Committee for Melbourne The future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Australia | 19\\nMade up of a range of industry experts from government, academia and the private sector to provide AI expertise, standards, research and support.

Department of Immigration,  Department of EducationKey Recommendation 7 –  Develop skills, curriculum and general AI literacy28 | Committee for Melbourne\\n6\\nThe Committee congratulates the Victorian Government for having already developed an important agenda of activities on AI. The Committee has collaborated with the Victorian Government on some of these initiatives, such as the VAPPGAI and –  for the last two years – the Committee’s  AI Summit held to coincide with the Victorian Government’s yearly Digital Innovation Festival.\\n To further the AI agenda, the Victorian Government has a significant role in:•  educating the community about their rights and the benefits that can be obtained from AI;•  educating and equipping the workforce with skills to ensure that we can attract and retain the right talent in Australia and Victoria for the innovation and application of AI;•  assisting stakeholders (public, private, educational etc) to commercialise, use, adapt and share information – including through practical use and testing of AI;• development of appropriate regulation; and•  providing incentives and support for development of AI initiatives, innovation, business development and attracting talent from overseas.This report, recognising the work already being done by the Victorian Government, identifies some key areas that could be considered by the Victorian Government to further the AI agenda. One of the key recommendations for the Victorian Government in this context is to take the lead on development  of a world class AI Precinct. The Victorian Government should consult industry, community and local councils to identify an AI precinct program. This might involve a feasibility study in the first instance, conducted in partnership with some major industry investors.It is anticipated that an AI Precinct would play a role as a ‘hub’ for AI technology (including for the regions), whereby other innovation precincts and hubs around Victoria could connect virtually into the central coordination centre. There are a lot of initiatives already available to organisations in Victoria, and for coordination purposes and to ensure that people within and external to Australia are able to take advantage of those initiatives, it would be beneficial to have a central coordination role for that activity. Coordination and prioritisation of AI activity will be critical to limit duplication within the ecosystem and enable knowledge sharing.The AI Precinct would also have the benefit of being a ‘physical space’ where learning and innovation could take place, including where AI initiatives could be publicly piloted and tested, showcased and developed with citizens engaged in the design and uptake process in order to demonstrate the benefits of AI. This would also enable the testing of public support for AI infrastructure and initiatives before committing to larger Smart City-scale rollouts,  such as those via City Deals. The AI Precinct  should ideally:  •  be populous and have world class digital connectivity; •  be highly accessible to public and private research communities;•  have close proximity or connection to cities that offer an attractive lifestyle – to ensure the attraction and retention of skills; and•  have a mix of business, industry, academia, residential and artistic community groups. Finally, any legislative reforms to be proposed in Victoria should be consistent with any changes that are occurring at a Commonwealth level. For example, changes to existing privacy laws to cover the use of AI systems in automated processing by Victorian public sector agencies would need to be made at a Victorian level, while reforms relating to the use of AI systems by businesses and Commonwealth Government entities will need to be made at a Commonwealth level. Nevertheless, there are significant opportunities for Victoria to take a leading role in these discussions and to influence  a national discussion on the use of AI.

Put simply, to build AI, having access to large quantities of robust data is a prerequisite; consequently, creation and management  of good quality and large volumes of data for AI forms a key theme in the AI strategy for several countries.\\nThe Australian Government published its AI Roadmap in November 2019 titled Artificial Intelligence: Solving problems, growing the economy and improving our quality of life (Commonwealth Government Roadmap).\\n7 Co-developed by CSIRO’s Data61 and the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, the intention of the report is to identify “strategies to help develop a national AI capability to boost the productivity of Australian industry, create jobs and economic growth, and improve the quality of life for current and future generations”.\\n8 The Commonwealth Government Roadmap identifies three high potential areas of AI specialisation for Australia: natural resources and environment; health, ageing and disability; and cities, towns and infrastructure. For AI pursuits in these arenas, data requirements will most likely extend beyond what is freely available in the public domain, which may necessitate new access to data that is owned and created by citizens or organisations. This will require careful consideration of a number of issues, including data privacy, ownership and security,  as well as data quality.Supporting\\t recommendations\\n7 Hajkowicz SA1+, Karimi S1, Wark T1, Chen C1, Evans M1, Rens N3, Dawson D1, Charlton A2, Brennan T2, Moffatt C2, Srikumar S2, Tong KJ2 (2019)  Artificial intelligence: Solving problems, growing the economy and improving our quality of life.

This necessarily requires data to be collected and managed in crucial areas and industries.The Commonwealth Government has identified three key areas (as outlined above), but there may also be further areas for the government to consider over time, such as education or the media sector.    Recommendation a:  Implement data collection and management initiatives to support AI for mission-critical outcomes in the key areas identified by the Commonwealth Government. This could potentially be a joint exercise between the Department of Industry, Science, Energy  and Resources (DISER), the NCAIEI  working in concert with the Office of the National Data Commissioner (ONDC). The Commonwealth Government has already committed to a National Data Commissioner to support a new data sharing and release framework, oversee the integrity of data sharing and release activities of Commonwealth agencies. However, greater and faster innovation and AI development can be achieved through public-private collaboration around data.     Recommendation b:  Expand the scope of Australia’s current  data sharing frameworks and partnerships  to include public-private data exchange supported by sustainable incentives for data sharing. The NCAIEI and ONDC may be well placed to oversee the public-private data exchange initiative.b) Data privacy and protection lawsA key and relevant concern of individuals in society is around the use of data and how it might breach the privacy of individuals or be used for inappropriate means. A right to privacy needs  to be protected.Mechanisms need to be put in place to a) control the use of data, b) to provide transparency in the use of data, and c) ensure the trust and understanding in the community about the protection of data.Australia has strong foundations by virtue of its privacy and competition laws, however a review is required to determine whether there are gaps that need to be covered. The Commonwealth Government has already committed to a new Consumer Data Right law to allow people to  harness and have greater control over their data and a legislative package that will streamline data sharing and release, subject to strict data privacy and confidentiality provisions. In addition, the ACCC’s Digital Platforms Inquiry: Final Report (ACCC Report) dated June 2019 has also discussed proposed recommendations (that are currently being considered by the Commonwealth Government after a period of public consultation) relating to possible reforms of consumer protection and privacy measures.Perhaps the most stringent form of privacy-related legislation that has been seen globally is in the EU with the General Data Protection Regulation, or ‘GDPR’, which has imposed significant new obligations on the use and processing of personal information, but has resulted in significant increases in compliance costs for businesses. Taking lessons from this, Australia should be considering how support might be given to businesses in the case  of any new laws or guidance that arises.    Recommendation c: Future data-related legislation must align with internationally expected standards and aim to balance protection and utility for AI. The ONDC  and OAIC may be appropriate to tackle  such initiatives.Supporting recommendations36 | Committee for Melbourne\\nc)  Frameworks and mechanisms for collection, management and sharing of data for AITo promote faster AI development, there is a need for transparent, safe and repeatable avenues to collect and manage the required data for different initiatives and domains. As such, Data Trusts, which have had some success overseas, are a concept that allow exploration of such frameworks – covering legal, technical, governance and policy-related mechanisms – which help increase access to data while retaining trust.     Recommendation d: Data Trusts should be piloted in Australia focusing on low  data-risk, high-value use cases initially.  The NCAIEI may be well placed to oversee the establishment and policies around  Data Trusts, in collaboration with Commonwealth departments. Currently, there are several key, yet isolated, data-related initiatives in progress, for example Australian Computer Society’s Data Sharing Framework and CSIRO’s development of the Consumer Data Standards. However, not all of these initiatives specifically relate to the use of data for AI systems. There is a need for AI-specific initiatives that focus on technical standards, proof of concepts and  data sharing frameworks to support a future of AI  in the public domain. There is a need for such pursuits to be managed more strategically under  a coherent technical framework that provides  clear and consistent guidelines for recommended design practices, importantly with consideration  of how this impacts or promotes the use of such data for AI pursuits. The intent is for such architectural guidelines to drive more consistent  and interoperable data and AI products at scale.    Recommendation e: A national level Technical Strategy should be developed to provide guiderails allowing for the standardisation of data collection, management and exchange of information for AI. This would encompass:  •  data design principles and standards for managing data quality, security and aspects of data life cycles (like lineage and provenance management);  •  a drive towards common standards for data exchange mechanisms, and  •  providing best-practice technical guidelines on technologies for data  assets such as Data Trusts.     This could be a joint initiative between CSIRO, Standards Australia, ABS and professional services firms with expertise in this space.7The\\tfuture\\tof\\tArtificial\\tIntelligence\\t(AI)\\tin\\tAustralia\\t|\\t37\\nAI is increasingly playing a role in the community and can have both beneficial and harmful consequences. For example, whilst AI can be used to deliver more efficient and effective services, it has also been used during electoral processes to deliver misleading information directly to voters through social media channels. \\nWhilst AI can be intentionally misused, there is also a possible risk of unintentional negative consequences arising from the use of AI. For example, AI is increasingly being used for service delivery in the public and private sector – such as insurance provision, finance access and employment application assessments. How these decisions are being made, what data is being used to generate those decisions (and whether there are any inherent biases in that data) and what impact they are having on the community are key issues that need to be considered.a) Governance frameworks The algorithms that underpin AI systems need to be understood, governed and monitored – but in a manner that is balanced to enable innovation and efficiencies to continue to be harnessed in an appropriate way. Therefore, a framework is required to enable this governance.Of the many issues that need to be considered in this context, ‘explainable AI’ is an important factor in affording trust and transparency around the use of AI. To align with the principle of transparency (which is already found in existing privacy laws in Australia), specific disclosures could be required where AI systems are used to make decisions that could affect the rights and obligations of individuals. One example of this can be found in Article 22 of the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, including Articles 13 and 14 (which require notification of any automated decision-making and provision of meaning information about the logic involved) and Article 22 (which limits the use of automated processing or profiling and requires that suitable protection measures are in place). These protection measures include the ability for affected individuals to request that an actual person review the automated decision. Implementing a similar legislative reform in Australia could be achieved relatively easily. Even with such a requirement being implemented, questions remain about explainability that continue to need consideration. For example, what counts  as an explanation? Who (or what) needs to understand the explanation? The ‘explainability’  of AI is important to avoid the ‘black box’ effect, where the results of algorithm decision-making  are not able to be understood or explained by suitably qualified humans. The EU has explained how equity and fairness need to be protected by ensuring explainability:  “ Explainability is therefore particularly important to ensure fairness in the use of algorithms and to identify potential bias in the training data. This far-reaching requirement means that an explanation should be available on how AI systems influence and shape the decision-making process, on how they are designed, and on what is the rationale for deploying them. Explainability must address both the technical processes of an AI system and the related human decisions taken in accordance with the EU guidelines.”\\n9\\nThere is a plethora of issues that need to be dealt with by a governance framework (whether in the form of legislation, industry standards or voluntary ethical principles). For example, the concept of human oversight and the mechanisms for humans to override a decision made by a system would be key areas to consider. Additionally, ensuring fundamental human rights are protected is also important, particularly in circumstances where AI systems are increasingly being used in areas where subjective decision-making might be needed, such as applying laws or issuing credit or insurance.\\n10\\n9 Tambiama Madiega, EU Guidelines on Ethics in Artificial Intelligence: context and implementation, EU Briefing, European Parliamentary Research Service, Members’ Research Service, PE 640.163 – September 2019 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=EPRS_BRI(2019)640163 (accessed 3 February 2020)\\n10 https://theconversation.com/csiro-wants-our-laws-turned-into-computer-code-heres-why-thats-a-bad-idea-130131Governance recommendationsBSupporting recommendations38 | Committee for Melbourne\\nAn ethical framework may therefore need to consider requirements for developers to consider the mechanisms and measures for human oversight and consideration of human rights.Another area of the law that will need to be clarified is attributing liability for the actions and decisions of AI systems. This poses a number of difficulties from a legal perspective, such as liability for a car accident involving an autonomous vehicle or financial ‘robo-advice’ given by an AI system. This would mean that in a hypothetical case of harm, affected individuals are likely to seek compensation from the entity that deployed the AI. Where it could be determined that harm was due to any regulatory obligations or governance frameworks not being complied with by the entity that developed the AI, then responsibility may be traced back to that entity instead. If the harm flowed from a breach of professional obligations, a professional negligence case could be brought against the IT company that trained or developed the AI system.   (i) Ethics principlesThe Commonwealth Government has proactively engaged with industry players to establish guidelines. In April 2019, the Commonwealth Government sought views on its Discussion  Paper to inform the Government’s approach  to AI ethics in Australia.\\n11\\nFollowing receipt of more than 130 submissions to the Discussion Paper (and a round of workshops), the Commonwealth Government published 8 AI ethics principles intended to be used when designing, developing, integrating or using AI systems to:• achieve better outcomes;• reduce the risk of negative impact; and•  practice the highest standards of ethical business and good governance.The principles are voluntary. They are aspirational only and not intended to have legal effect.\\n11  The Ethics Framework research was funded by the Commonwealth Government in the 2018 May Budget. The work was guided by a steering committee of experts from industry, government and community organisations as well as researchers from CSIRO and Data61.The eight AI ethics principles are summarised as follows: 01   Human, social and environmental wellbeing: Throughout their lifecycle, AI systems should benefit individuals, society and the environment.02   Human-centred values: Throughout  their lifecycle, AI systems should respect human rights, diversity, and the autonomy of individuals.03   Fairness: Throughout their lifecycle, AI systems should be inclusive and accessible, and should not involve or  result in unfair discrimination against individuals, communities or groups.04   Privacy protection and security: Throughout their lifecycle, AI systems should respect and uphold privacy rights and data protection and ensure the  security of data.05   Reliability and safety: Throughout  their lifecycle, AI systems should  reliably operate in accordance with  their intended purpose.06   Transparency and explainability:  There should be transparency and responsible disclosure to ensure people know when they are being significantly impacted by an AI system, and can find out when an AI system is engaging with them.07   Contestability: When an AI system significantly impacts a person, community, group or environment, there should be a timely process to allow people to challenge the use or output of the AI system.08   Accountability: Those responsible for  the different phases of the AI system lifecycle should be identifiable and accountable for the outcomes of the AI systems, and human oversight of AI systems should be enabled.\\nSource: accessed 11/11/2019 https://www.industry.gov.au/data-and-publications/building-australias-artificial-intelligence-capability/ai-ethics-framework/ai-ethics-principles7The\\tfuture\\tof\\tArtificial\\tIntelligence\\t(AI)\\tin\\tAustralia\\t|\\t39\\nCommonwealth Bank of Australia, Telstra, National Australia Bank, Microsoft and Flamingo AI have signed on to trial the new set of principles governing the development of systems using AI, following the government consultation period for a national ethical framework. These companies have agreed to a trial period during which decisions taken on developing systems using AI will be referenced against the checklist of principles, to try to avoid creating unintended harmful consequences.\\n12\\nAny guidelines established should help define layers of roles and responsibilities of industry at large, firms, and individuals, including executives and developers, in playing their parts and making them accountable in advancing rigorous testing of AI algorithms that minimise their risks to society and promote fair, transparent and secure use, based on the highest ethical considerations. The standards released by the Commonwealth Government should encourage business to undertake an AI risk analysis and put in place mitigating strategies to prevent harms in the use of AI. At present these levels of accountability, and specifics in responsibilities, are implied but not explicitly incorporated into the ethics principles that have been proposed by the Commonwealth Government. If these principles are to be adopted more widely or if compliance with these ethics principles is to become a legal or other binding obligation, further detail and interpretive guidance will be required. (ii) Further standards settingThe ethics principles established by the Commonwealth Government have gone some  way towards providing high level guidance on  these issues, but there are still questions around  the clarity that the principles provide for how  people can comply with them, as well as the  layers of responsibility and who is responsible  and accountable. More work is needed to  ensure clarity around these issues is provided. Government will be required to form an opinion over time on how it will manage these concepts and this may involve the development of a legislative framework. The Commonwealth Government could consider the setting up an independent ethical body along the lines of the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation in the UK (the purpose of which is to connect policymakers, industry, civil society and the public to develop the right governance regime for data-driven technologies).One of the key recommendations in this document is for a National AI Centre of Data Ethics and Innovation (NAICEI) to be established. This seems to be in line with the proposal by the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) in its ‘Human Rights and Technology Discussion Paper’ December 2019. Amongst the many proposals being consulted on (with a Final Report due in 2020), the AHRC in its Proposal 2 states: “ Proposal 2: The Australian Government should commission an appropriate independent body to enquire into ethical frameworks for new and emerging technologies to:  (a)  assess the efficacy of existing ethical frameworks in protecting and promoting human rights  (b)  identify opportunities to improve the operation of ethical frameworks, such as through consolidation or harmonisation of similar frameworks, and by giving special legal status to ethical frameworks that meet certain criteria.” \\n13\\nGiven that there are already many AI-focused initiatives underway across the country, a cohesive strategy for coordinating an approach to the governance of AI is essential – and needs to be considered as a matter of urgency. A strategic approach is needed to ensure that relevant research is consolidated and shared, resources are deployed efficiently, and that governments, industry, academia and other relevant stakeholders are involved  in these discussions.\\n12  Federal Government, Media Release, 7 November 2019, Businesses ready to test AI ethics principles https://www.minister.industry.gov.au/ministers/karenandrews/media-releases/businesses-ready-test-ai-ethics-principles (accessed 18/02/20)\\n13 Australian Human Rights Commission, Human Rights and Technology Discussion Paper, Executive Summary, 2019, page 7Supporting recommendations40 | Committee for Melbourne\\nAs the AHRC points out in its Proposal 9 of the 2019 Human Rights and Technology Discussion Paper:“ Centres of expertise, including the newly established Australian Research Council Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society, should prioritise research on how to design AI-informed decision-making systems to provide a reasonable explanation to individuals.”\\n14\\nAnother example of the work that is already being done is in the Melbourne Carlton precinct. Melbourne University’s Melbourne Law School is spearheading some research agencies in this precinct as follows: 1)  A Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Digital Ethics (CAIDE) made of groups being Melbourne Law School (MLS), the School of Computing and Information Systems (CIS) in the Melbourne School of Engineering and the Faculty of Arts. Acting as an ‘interdisciplinary research body’ –  it will be located at Melbourne Connect in Carlton and one research focus is ‘Fairness and Anti-Discrimination in Automated Decision-Making’.2)  They are setting up an Australian Research Council (ARC) Centre of Excellence for Automated Decision-Making and Society.  MLS, CIS, other Australian universities and  global industry partners using ARC funding.\\n15\\nThere are many examples of research such as this across the country. A coordinated approach should be taken, and the location might be important as well. As outlined later in this document, an AI Precinct as a central coordination point might well be an appropriate place to host such a centre.Given the number of these bodies that are being established, the establishment of a central agency to coordinate such activities would be advisable.      Recommendation f: Commonwealth Government to consider the  development and implementation of principle-based frameworks and codes  of practice for AI technologies. The National Centre of AI Ethics and Innovation (NCAIEI) can assist with standards setting – working with agencies like CSIRO and Standards Australia     Recommendation g: NCAIEI to  conduct research into ethical use of  AI and coordinate research.\\n14  Australian Human Rights Commission, Human Rights and Technology Discussion Paper, Executive Summary, 2019, page 10\\n15  Cat Knights, The ethics of Artificial Intelligence, Melbourne Law School, mlsNews, November 2019, pages 7-87\\nThe\\tfuture\\tof\\tArtificial\\tIntelligence\\t(AI)\\tin\\tAustralia\\t|\\t41\\nb) Ethical use of AI Ethical use of AI needs to be incentivised and regulated. As discussed above, each regulator dealing with different legislative frameworks such as privacy (the OAIC), discrimination (the AHRC), competition (the ACCC), corporations law (ASIC) and financial services regulation (APRA) will need to have the resources and expertise to regulate AI within their area of responsibility. However, these agencies might need the support of a central body that has specific AI expertise.Additional governance frameworks will need to be considered and implemented in order to support and enforce any legislative changes, as well as existing legislation requirements. Options for consideration will depend on the approach taken to legislative changes, but possible options (which would not be mutually exclusive) include: •  an AI Ombudsman that is empowered to deal with complaints from individuals in relation to the use of AI by businesses and government; •  clarifying the jurisdiction of existing regulators in relation to AI, including the ACCC, ASIC, APRA and the OAIC; •  creation of an AI Centre of Ethics and Innovation to coordinate research and development of ethical principles and governance frameworks and to provide support for regulators; and•  creation of a professional standards body/or specific standards for the AI industry (which could be developed through the NCAIEI).(i) Provision of AI-related support by the NCAIEIAs set out above, there are many regulatory agencies that will need to investigate AI-related issues in the industries and areas that they regulate, whether that be privacy, discrimination, competition or corporations law. Whilst many of these agencies will need to have their own dedicated AI teams, they will also need support from a central body that can help with research and provide technical expertise. An option would be to have a specific regulator which would be able to investigate breaches of  laws, where AI is playing a role. However, there  is no precedent for this yet around the world, and  it is unclear whether a regulator for all industries  is a possibility. Whilst the EU has established new legislation (e.g. GDPR) they have stopped short of setting up a new regulatory body.\\n16 Accordingly, this report recommends that a body be set up with specific AI expertise, which regulators in general can draw upon for help. Rather than create multiple separate bodies, it would be more efficient for the provision  of such support and guidance to be performed by the proposed NCAIEI.      Recommendation h: NCAIEI to provide resources and support for regulators to  regulate the use of AI.Supporting recommendations\\n16  Tambiama Madiega, EU Guidelines on Ethics in Artificial Intelligence: context and implementation, EU Briefing, European Parliamentary Research Service, Members’ Research Service, PE 640.163 – September 2019 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document.html?reference=EPRS_BRI(2019)640163 (accessed 3 February 2020)42 | Committee for Melbourne\\n7\\n(ii) OmbudsmanAn independent ombudsman as a complaint handling body is a typical mechanism in many industries. This body will deal with complaints in relation to the use of AI by businesses and government. Legislative change would be required to give jurisdiction to this ombudsman.     Recommendation i: AI Ombudsman  is set up by the Commonwealth Government as an independent body outside of the NCAIEI to act as an independent complaint handling body  for consumer complaints arising from  the use of AI.c) Updating existing laws Victorian and Commonwealth government bodies should consider appropriate changes to existing legislation, potentially in the form of a multi-stage process of first making minor amendments to existing privacy laws to cover automated processing (and other relevant legislation like competition, corporations, discrimination laws) and subsequently developing principles-based AI-specific legislation. Governments should consult with industry on developments in this area prior to implementing  any new requirements.The ACCC’s Digital Platforms Inquiry: Final Report (ACCC Report) dated June 2019, contains recommendations across areas like competition, consumer protection, copyright and privacy issues. Those recommendations are currently being considered and responded to by the Commonwealth Government. Although the Inquiry has had a particular focus on the conduct of Google and Facebook, its proposals go beyond these  digital platforms.The ACCC Report noted that laws across a range of areas should be considered as a part of the Commonwealth Government’s review, for example (amongst others):• merger laws and corporations laws; • news media laws; and• the Australian Consumer Law. To align with the principle of transparency (which is already found in existing privacy laws in Australia), specific disclosures could be required where AI systems are used to make decisions that could affect the rights and obligations of individuals. Due to Australia’s federal system of laws, some of this legislative change will need to be undertaken at a state and territory level and some reforms will need to occur at a Commonwealth level.\\nThe\\tfuture\\tof\\tArtificial\\tIntelligence\\t(AI)\\tin\\tAustralia\\t|\\t43\\nIn addition to amending relevant laws, regulators may need to enhance their AI-related capabilities. For example, the ACCC Report highlighted that it may need a specialist unit of the ACCC to deal with digital markets. However, regulators may also need support from AI experts in regulating AI issues. Therefore – in addition to having internal expertise – regulators may need to draw upon knowledge provided by other government agencies, or through the NCAIEI.    Recommendation j: Commonwealth government bodies should consider appropriate changes to existing legislation and consult with industry on developments in this area, including the preferred regulatory model (including possibly creating a professional standards body for the AI industry), prior to implementing any new requirements. Victorian Government bodies should consider appropriate changes to existing legislation to cover the use of AI systems by government agencies.   Recommendation k: Additional governance frameworks will need to be considered and implemented in order to support and enforce any legislative changes. This will require clarifying the jurisdiction of existing regulators in relation to AI, including the ACCC and the OAIC, and equipping these regulators with the necessary technical capacity to understand and regulate the  use of AI systems within the scope of  their jurisdiction.     Recommendation l: Commonwealth Government to consider mechanisms such as partnerships, collaborations and funding to ensure that the NCAIEI, AI Ombudsman and all regulators are sufficiently resourced, funded, skilled and adaptable to keep up with constantly changing trends and innovations.The Commonwealth also has a role in sharing information and educating the community, including government, businesses, academia and other stakeholders about the importance, uses and trends of AI. In order to be nimble and be able to respond that that information, a bi-partisan approach may be needed. Accordingly, just as the Victorian Parliament has established the VAPPGAI, the Australian All-Party Parliamentary Group on Artificial Intelligence (AAPPGAI) might be established  to achieve those aims.    Recommendation m: Commonwealth Parliament to establish AAPPGAI.Supporting recommendations44 | Committee for Melbourne\\n7\\na)  Embedding human rights into legislation  and frameworks\\nA key and relevant concern of individuals  in society is the use of data and how it might breach the privacy of individuals,  but also, how it might be used for inappropriate means. People’s rights  need to be protected. \\nIncreasingly, AI is being used to make decisions that affect the interests or rights of individuals. Mechanisms need to be put in place to a) protect people’s rights and b) ensure equality of access for people – to prevent a system that reinforces the division in the community into ‘have and have nots’.Australia already has strong privacy and competition laws. However more can be done to specifically deal with AI creation and use in the AI space. Governments, in partnership with technology firms and industry stakeholders, should develop and implement principle-based frameworks, in which human rights are protected in the development  and use of AI technologies across public and  private sectors.Governments should build or strengthen capability within existing regulatory bodies to oversee changes and impacts resulting from AI adoption. A central advisory council or NCAIEI could be established to provide advice, collaboration and share learnings across government, central agencies, regulators and industry. This approach has been taken by countries such as the UK, Canada and Singapore, where non-profit advisory councils provide central coordination for research, funding and ethical considerations.When AI systems are being developed, particularly for applications that can affect the wellbeing of individuals or produce outcomes with negative consequences, rigorous testing should be taken across the lifecycle. This includes but is not limited to: probing training data for bias; pre-release trials; independent auditing; ongoing monitoring; and verification. Specific analysis should be done to identify bias, discrimination or other harm. A set of good practices that provide guidelines rather than prescriptive regulation may help companies better deliver AI services and products. The EU ethical guidelines for AI provide high-level principles for all of the issues identified, while not relying heavily on regulation (with the exception of data privacy through the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)). The Committee notes that the AHRC has considered many of these key issues in its ‘Human Rights and Technology Discussion Paper’ December 2019. Amongst the many proposals being consulted (with a Final Report  due in 2020), the AHRC in its Proposal 1 states:  “ Proposal 1: The Australian Government should develop a National Strategy on New and Emerging Technologies. This National Strategy should:  (c)  set the national aim of promoting responsible innovation and protecting human rights  (d)  prioritise and resource national leadership  on artificial intelligence (AI)  (e)  promote effective regulation – this includes law, co-regulation and self-regulation   (f)  resource education and training for government, industry and civil society.”\\n17\\nThe recommendations in this section below are in addition to recommendations already outlined above, that seek to deal with ethics (such as the ethics principles as well as the establishment of  a research agency to develop further initiatives around ethics).     Recommendation n: Commonwealth Government to consider appropriate changes to existing legislation, with a first step being making minor amendments to existing privacy laws to require the disclosure of the use of AI in automated processing or decision-making.     Recommendation o: Governments at all levels should play an active role in making information available and accessible with regards to the use of AI in the public domain. \\n17 Australian Human Rights Commission, Human Rights and Technology Discussion Paper, Executive Summary, 2019, page 6Equity and equality recommendations CThe\\tfuture\\tof\\tArtificial\\tIntelligence\\t(AI)\\tin\\tAustralia\\t|\\t45\\nb)  Embedding equity into education and skills curriculum and talent poolGovernments, seeking input from the higher education sector and (global) industry, need to adapt education policy to foster the next generation of talent in AI, focusing on promotion of diversity and inclusion in those being educated, as well as ensuring the curriculum fosters an understanding of ethics and equity principles. Policy frameworks need to target early and higher education systems to train technically capable and ethically responsible pool of talents in AI. Policy should help develop and retain talent and researchers knowledgeable and comfortable in working with AI both from technical, ethical, and governance perspectives.    Recommendation p: Commonwealth  and Victorian Governments ensure that ethics and equity and human rights principles are incorporated into any AI curriculum. The national AI curriculum could be developed by the NCAIEI in conjunction with departments like Department of Education, ASQA and TESQA.   Recommendation q: Commonwealth Government to consider policies and mechanisms such as community-based projects and government funded PhD scholarship places that focus on diversity and inclusion of AI talent development to drive diversity and inclusion in next generation of AI talent. generation of AI talent. c) Educate the communityThe Victorian Government, specifically, should explore partnerships with industry stakeholders in developing case studies and piloting AI projects with various communities to increase understanding, enhance skills, and foster inclusion in the use of AI. In this way, making information available and accessible with regards to the use of AI in the public domain, will not only provide assurances and confidence to communities and safeguard rights to information, but also empower them and allay unwarranted fears of new technologies.   Recommendation r: Victorian Government possibly with VAPPGAI, should explore partnerships with  industry stakeholders in developing  case studies and education programs.   Recommendation s: Victorian Government develops an AI Precinct  that is able to test and pilot AI initiatives  to ensure they are fair and equitable for  the community.community.Supporting recommendations46 | Committee for Melbourne\\nInfrastructure that enables AI adoption, innovation and activity needs to be planned and developed. This includes for example digital capability like smart sensors embedded in physical assets (e.g. hospitals, roads, airports etc), connectivity and computer power.\\nCommittee for Melbourne advocates for an integrated transport plan that ensures that public and private transport options and different modes of transport and services are considered within the plan. This must necessarily include the incorporation of physical and digital AI capability throughout our transport infrastructure and planned services (e.g. the capability to adapt roads for appropriate technologies like smart sensors to accommodate autonomous vehicles in the future).a) Frameworks for infrastructure designPlanning and operating our civil infrastructure efficiently is already highly complex and is becoming a key application area for AI. Unfortunately, much  of our civic infrastructure is ageing and not designed to accommodate the AI infrastructure that could play a role in its management. Standards Australia and IEC are focused on communications network and data-related standards; less emphasis is placed  on integrating AI infrastructure into civil infrastructure design.The Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP), the Victorian Planning Authority (VPA) and civil design agencies should engage with Standards Australia to specify minimum, good, and best practice design so that future civil infrastructure can have AI infrastructure designed in while achieving energy and carbon neutrality and retaining present safely and performance benchmarks in compliance with the Planning and Environment Act.       Recommendation t: DELWP , the VPA  and local civil design agencies should engage with Standards Australia to specify minimum, good, and best practice design for incorporating AI systems into  civil infrastructure.     Recommendation u: Infrastructure Victoria should collaborate with design agencies to ensure that Victoria’s 30-year infrastructure strategy acknowledges AI infrastructure as an integral piece of Victoria’s infrastructure, and encourages  AI infrastructure to be designed in and  built in to Victoria’s future civil infrastructure, in accordance with relevant laws, ethical standards and national interoperability requirements. b) Procurement policiesAgencies responsible for developing state assets, including transport, power, water utilities etc need  to have planned responses to AI technology.    Recommendation v: Department of Treasury and Finance and Buying for Victoria (formerly Tenders Victoria) should collaborate with industry representatives to align the state’s procurement process with the Commonwealth Government Artificial Intelligence Roadmap (section 8.2 –  “AI for Better Towns, Cities and Infrastructure”), including:  •  Requiring AI enabling provisions to be specified and designed into future physical infrastructure projects to allow orderly and convenient transition to a future AI society.   •  Encouraging collaboration between infrastructure owners and AI proponents at the planning, design and tendering stages of infrastructure projects.   •  Placing increased gravitas on innovation and value over cost alone during the planning, design and tendering stages  of infrastructure projects. Infrastructure recommendations D7The\\tfuture\\tof\\tArtificial\\tIntelligence\\t(AI)\\tin\\tAustralia\\t|\\t47\\nc)  Innovation and development in AI infrastructure technologyA precinct-level strategy in Melbourne would complement existing recommendations in the Commonwealth Government Roadmap to consider smart cities. A precinct-level strategy might allow the opportunity to innovate and test for infrastructure development. The precinct-level strategy might also be the location for a NCAIEI.     Recommendation w: Victorian Government to advocate for development of an AI Precinct, which would enable careful exploration of the emergent issues  of AI infrastructure in society.Supporting recommendations\\n48 | Committee for Melbourne\\nFundamentally, the security concerns  in an AI-driven world are similar to the concerns of cyber security and there are more issues beyond cyber security: protection of confidentiality of data; intellectual property; protecting the integrity of the AI or computerised process; as well as the availability of the systems and the services being enabled by AI\\n.AI security is a field which has substantial overlap with the cyber security field; but neither the threats nor the remedies are necessarily the same. The AI security field is an extension of cyber security and cannot be considered in isolation from it. There are similar concerns to cybersecurity that need to be addressed – that is – the protection of data and the protection of systems and users from malfeasance. For example:a)  The implementation of AI security should be assessed by assessing the 3D’s - design, development and deployment: e.g. a traditional cybersecurity perspective.b)  Certain AI data must be housed in a secure ecosystem to ensure sensitive data remains secure. However, there are new dimensions to AI security (over and above cyber security) which must be addressed as the modes and vectors of attack are different. For example:c)  Actors with bad intentions can learn to fool AI and exploit systems for criminal purposes through passive and active malfeasance.d)  AI can be used as a force multiplier to enhance security systems.e)  As society becomes more reliant on AI, then systems to ensure access to AI may need  to be secured.a) Security of AI implementation AI implementation should be assessed by reviewing the factors which impact society and business should the AI system be compromised through cyber means. For example, AI algorithms should be designed to instil the right fail safe design controls, the use of secure coding practices and other safeguards against manipulation.The security of AI implementation should be assessed by following the 3D’s - Design, Development and Deployment.      Recommendation x: NCAIEI should  research and provide guidance to industry  on how to incorporate security into the design, development and deployment of AI. Industry should be encouraged to participate in this research. b)  Security legislation and frameworks – protection from malfeasance and integrity compromiseSecuring AI systems poses unique challenges. We must consider how we can use cyber security to effectively prevent threats posed to AI-based programs and applications.There are two aspects to malfeasance:•  passive malfeasance, where an AI is not changed, but manipulated to produce outcomes not intended by the designer. Malfeasance and manipulation of AI algorithms to produce a biased or desired output has to be protected by the means of access control to the systems, rigorous testing using fail safe controls, where AI exceeds certain parameters of generated outputs etc (see for example Juuti et al. (2019)); and•  active malfeasance is where the AI is subverted, damaged or intruded upon in some way through issues such as data poisoning, subversion, adversarial attack etc. For example, a malicious adversary can surreptitiously manipulate the input data so as to exploit specific vulnerabilities of learning algorithms and compromise the security of the machine learning system using adversarial attack techniques by passing traditional controls which are supposed to protect the environment. Security recommendations E7The\\tfuture\\tof\\tArtificial\\tIntelligence\\t(AI)\\tin\\tAustralia\\t|\\t49\\nAI-fuelled insights will deliver higher quality of experience (QoE) and better services. Given the kinds of highly responsible tasks that AI algorithms have to carry out, the risk of algorithmic compromise makes the issue of cybersecurity in AI even more important.    Recommendation y: NCAIEI is funded to undertake research into the development of appropriate and balanced legislation, frameworks and standards designed to ensure the security of AI systems and protect these systems from being abused  or compromised by malicious third parties.  c) Using AI cybersecurity as a force multiplierUse of AI in cybersecurity can act as a force multiplier for advanced threat detection as well as a key robustness feature in order to deter, detect and prevent threats from happening on mission critical systems.This paradigm presents great opportunity. AI, in conjunction with machine learning and big data models, is being increasingly used in decision making with a high probabilistic certainty. This level of certainty can be close to the human certainty in solving the biggest cybersecurity challenges. Some of these challenges are those of identifying the right skilled resources and early identification of new and emerging attack vectors.In addition, AI tooling for advanced cyber threat detection has led to a number of vendors and research labs establishing a number of cybersecurity AI-led detection initiatives, such as IBM (Watson), Darktrace (anomaly detection), advanced UEBA technologies etc.    Recommendation z: Research between government and private sector into AI tooling for advanced cyber threat detection.  d) Protection of AI availabilityAvailability of AI systems and algorithms is a key challenge, as many of the ecosystems of the future are dependent on AI to decide, self-allocate and manage them (such as 5G, connected car ecosystem etc). Loss of availability for AI driven algorithms due to bugs, software security vulnerabilities and threats caused by various factors may lead to detrimental consequences (although many developments do take this into account, so that systems can continue to manage in the absence of AI).    Recommendation aa: Research into whether there are areas where it is essential to make AI systems, networks (eg 5G) and algorithms highly available, and how this might be achieved.Supporting recommendations50 | Committee for Melbourne\\nJust as the internet transformed the trade ecosystem in the late 1990s through the introduction of online catalogues, targeted marketing and a new age of customer convenience, AI has already transformed the trade landscape once more. Advances in machine learning and automated decision-making techniques – the engines that drive the majority of products falling under the AI umbrella – have brought forth a new wave of innovation that will soon  be at the forefront of improving not only  the internal efficiency of businesses  but also the quality of products delivered  to customers.\\nFor businesses, AI will drive internal business optimisation of product development and delivery through improvements in the ability to extract information from existing big data. AI grants the ability to use analytics to develop products tailored to customers.For consumers, AI also provides direct benefits (such as improving the accessibility of products through online platforms). For example, the recent development of sophisticated chatbots by organisations such as Alibaba provide a fast interface for customers to find the exact product they are looking for when browsing online, as well as automatically providing information on stock and delivery details that alleviate the need for cumbersome customer support networks.a)  Leveraging AI through internal business modelsIn order to reap the full benefit AI will offer, governments at a state and federal level must take the necessary provisions with respect to infrastructure and small and medium enterprise (SME) support to remain competitive against large overseas multinationals that will otherwise quickly outpace Australian organisations.The vast majority of industries associated with trade rely on the traditional e-commerce business model of using consumer analytics to guide focused marketing strategies that funnel customers into several generalised products. The recent increase in Platforms as a Service (PaaS) such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud and AI utilities or software such as Software as a Service (SaaS) are some of the most significant driving forces for AI proliferation. Being fundamental to data analysis and the training of machine learning models, PaaS allows SMEs to compete with large corporations in terms of leveraging AI to reap the benefits of a transformed business model. However, the benefit of an increasingly inter-dependant ecosystem comes  with the challenge of requiring a fast and robust network infrastructure. To take full advantage of PaaS, government bodies must work closely with industry to provide the proper infrastructure necessary for those organisations to adopt and use AI technology.There are practical steps for businesses to leverage the AI opportunity: AI operating model, drive technology-led culture and participation in knowledge sharing. In order to facilitate knowledge sharing, the Government can facilitate SMEs from organisations, universities and institutions to create a community of industry experts and professionals. This community can then provide advice and consultation for businesses who are looking to bolster their AI capability.     Recommendation bb: Commonwealth Government, through the NCAIEI, and Victorian Government through the development of an AI Precinct, financially supports and educates SMEs to access  and benefit from AI systems.Trade recommendations F7The\\tfuture\\tof\\tArtificial\\tIntelligence\\t(AI)\\tin\\tAustralia\\t|\\t51\\nb) AI CommerceThe opportunity for industries to shift their  business model also comes with the need to properly educate a specialised workforce that understands the capabilities and limits of AI within the business context. The insights that AI provides are only as valuable, for example, as the quality of the data inputs and the data scientist’s ability to understand how those insights can be extracted  in different contexts.    Case Study: Commonwealth Bank customer engagement engine  The Commonwealth Bank’s customer engagement engine (CEE) allows the  bank to have more proactive, needs-based conversations with customers, regardless  of which channel the customer came in  through. Over 200+ AI models drive next  best conversations which aim to improve  the financial wellbeing of CBA customers  by providing relevant conversation starters  such as notifying them of when a repayment  is due to avoid late fees or even helping customers discover if they are missing out  on benefits, rebates or concession payments. This AI led capability allows Commonwealth Bank to have relevant, meaningful  conversations with their customers,  delivering a one to one experience that  makes the interaction with customers easier.      Recommendation cc: NCAIEI to conduct research and provide advice and education to the community, government and business on commercialisation of AI.Supporting recommendations\\n52 | Committee for Melbourne\\nThere are three current challenges which are impacting Victoria and Australia’s ability to realise the full benefits offered by the arrival of AI. These are: limited availability  of AI skills; current low AI adoption rates  in Australia due to limits in understanding  of AI’s potential or concerns regarding  new risks it introduces; and limited information sharing between groups  within the local ecosystem, on the  value of AI to their operations.\\nThe Australian Government Roadmap highlights  the following:•  Australian industry needs up to 161,000 new specialist AI workers by 2030 in machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing and other AI technologies.•  The Australian information, communications and technology (ICT) sector employs 663,100 workers in fields related to AI. This will grow to 758,700 workers by 2023 at a rate of 20,000 additional workers per year. Today 66,000 ICT workers live  in remote and regional areas. Australia will need to invest in boosting AI specialist and general skills if it is to take full advantage of emerging opportunities generated by the arrival  of AI.This will include not only investing to help the current workforce to add new skills and understanding of AI, in particular in industries expected to be most impacted by AI’s arrival, but also to boost the volume of AI specialists in Australia, to meet the expected rise in demand across the ecosystem.Also, as global investment and demand for these skills increases, Australia will find itself competing to access – and retain – talent and to stay competitive, as AI usage increases. a)  Rewarding companies and organisations that invest in skillsIn order to ensure Australia has and retains the skills needed to proactively embrace AI, focused initiatives are needed to encourage upskilling of the workforce, including new entrants and  existing workers, to raise their aptitude to adopt  and embrace AI in their roles.This may include offering incentives for  training, or investment into R&D into applying  AI in their industry.      Recommendation dd: Commonwealth and/or Victorian Government incentivising and promoting companies who invest early in building the AI skills base in their organisations. b) Attracting and retaining AI talent in AustraliaIn order to maintain and grow Australia’s talent pool in AI, incentives should also be strengthened to encourage AI specialists to remain in Australia or relocate to take on industry opportunities here.In addition, AI-skills should be given strong priority in the consideration of candidates for skillset migration to Australia. This may be delivered through an increased focus or priority for AI skills as part of the Government’s recently launched Global Talent Independent Program (GTIP), including consideration of offering an AI Talent visa, considered along similar lines to the current Distinguished Talent visa.Government might consider actively incentivising Australian AI skilled professionals to remain in Australia, or if currently boosting their expertise overseas, to return to Australia to support upskilling within the local ecosystem.This type of promotion could assist Australia in competing in the global talent pool for specialist AI skills, with a focus on sectors where we have comparative need or advantage. This could include adding further focus to the existing talent visa programs to prioritise acceleration of applications for candidates with specialised AI skills. The Government might also consider incentives to encourage Australian expatriate technology experts to return to Australia either individually, or bringing their businesses, including consideration of a one-off income or stamp duty subsidy (to offset a portion of reintegration costs for them to return to Australia).Skills recommendations G7The\\tfuture\\tof\\tArtificial\\tIntelligence\\t(AI)\\tin\\tAustralia\\t|\\t53\\n    Recommendation ee: Commonwealth and/or Victorian Government to provide incentives for AI skilled people and businesses to come to, or return to, Australia – e.g. specialist taxation and business incentives.     Recommendation ff: Commonwealth Government to introduce and actively promote a special AI Talent visa category, to demonstrate Australia’s prioritisation of these skills in migration practices.    Recommendation gg: Commonwealth and/or Victorian Government to grow the number of AI specialists entering Australia’s workforce, including via direct support for undergraduate, graduate and PhD scholarships, to encourage students to progress their careers into needed capability streams.    Recommendation hh: Commonwealth and/or Victorian Government to undertake a targeted promotional campaign to support workers and organisations in better understanding the potentially positive impacts of AI on their careers, and profitability, by highlighting new role opportunities created, and productivity or community impacts realised, by early AI adopters. c) Helping people to be upskilled for new jobsNew and emerging jobs might require upskilling and reskilling for existing jobs. Soft skills are transferable skills which can be applied to many different jobs and industries.  They include problem solving, critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, leadership, teamwork and self-management. The capacity to innovate will be the bedrock of Australia’s future competitiveness. In an age of accelerated transformation, new digital technologies are transforming traditional business  processes and models and enabling people to communicate and collaborate in ways previously  not possible. Australia is now ranked 23rd  in the world for innovation,\\n18 while our global competitiveness is at its lowest point in 18 years.\\n19With the nature of work set for continuous change over the coming decades, there is the need to not only educate our community about the need for lifelong learning and upskilling, but to provide an environment that enables its implementation. For example, traditional roles like building and construction trades will continue in the future but may require some additional skills sets such as use of computer technology for the trade. The development and recognition of micro-credentials, which complement our existing educational framework, will be essential  to facilitate lifelong learning and upskilling.      Recommendation ii: Commonwealth and/or Victorian Government to develop and fund education programs in schools and higher education/VET that develop soft skills such as creativity and innovation.    Recommendation jj: Commonwealth and/or Victorian Government to develop and fund micro-credentials in schools and higher education/VET. d) Sharing information between organisationsSharing information between groups within the local ecosystem on the value of AI to their operations will assist in training, skilling and equipping the workforce, especially where the ecosystem includes academia. This is outlined further in the innovation section below, however, the deliberate fostering of sharing through physical space, as well as virtual space, has been seen to have great benefits for skills and innovation (e.g. Silicon Valley).    Recommendation kk: Victorian Government to explore establishment of  an (or several) AI Precincts to further AI skills via information and innovation sharing and creating an attractive place for skilled  AI professionals to work, to collaborate or to find out about other work opportunities around Victoria.  \\n18 https://www.globalinnovationindex.org/gii-2018-report#\\n19  https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-competitiveness-report-2017-2018Supporting recommendations54 | Committee for Melbourne\\na)  Protect and promote Australian technology start-ups\\nGovernments generally have an important role in exploring partnerships with industry stakeholders. This includes developing case studies and piloting AI projects with various communities to increase understanding, enhance skills, and foster inclusion in the use of AI, as well as to help in the development of new AI innovations and collaboration between academia, different industries and the community. \\nGiven the rate of innovation in AI, there is a need to create an environment for start-up culture to thrive and accelerate translation to commercial success. One mechanism to foster this is to set up regional AI innovation centres that provide the support and services needed by aspiring AI tech start-ups, and access to consultative expertise when required, working in collaboration with existing industry bodies, including the Australian Growth Networks and Cooperative Research Centres (CRCs). The recent launch of the AI Hub in Melbourne is a great step in this direction. Additional considerations need to be made around availability of funding, expert assistance and global marketing of the programs and safe spaces to test and train AI in accordance with regulations and ethical goals.Victoria is not always the leader in such trials. For example, RACWA’s Automated Vehicle Program is trialling the autonomous vehicle technology in real-life traffic conditions through its RAC Intellibus program, to help us better understand and prepare for the changes it will bring to mobility.\\n20 Governments need to consider ways of facilitating pilot programs – and in the absence of a coordinated national approach, the Victorian Government has an opportunity to lead the way in this area.The Victorian Government has a unique opportunity to conduct these programs, because there are already precincts around Greater Melbourne and in the regions that are focused on technology and innovation, and have pre-existing academic, private sector and government partnerships – like Monash, Parkville/Carlton and Fisherman’s Bend.     Recommendation ll: Victorian Government to establish one or several AI Precincts in Australia as a mechanism to test, develop, promote and showcase the use of AI in more innovative, yet to be commercialised, settings focusing on the physical environment.    Recommendation mm: Victorian Government to invest further in incubators, accelerators, events and co-working spaces to provide an environment where expertise can be shared, cultivating a culture of collaboration which is the key for Australia’s digital growth. b) Scale-up AI-driven businessesAvailability of early finance is a key enabler for commercialisation of AI. Further, innovation funding could initially be targeted to public or private organisations promoting initiatives within Australia’s AI focus arenas - towns and infrastructure, natural resources and environment and health, ageing and disability. The government should design specific funding streams for this program based on Australia’s need, with every stream having its own set of objectives.    Recommendation nn: Commonwealth (and/or Victorian Government) to establish an Innovation Fund – or reprioritise existing grant programs – to target projects which accelerate AI development. This could include dedicating a proportion of existing funding streams such as: Australian Research Council (ARC), National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and Innovations Connections program funding. c) Feasibility study on an AI Precinct The reasons for an AI Precinct being useful are outlined in Section 4C and include its ability to operate as a virtual hub for the innovation precincts across Victoria, as well as a physical space where piloting and testing can be conducted.\\n20  https://rac.com.au/about-rac/advocating-change/initiatives/automated-vehicle-program (Accessed 3 February 2020) Innovation and entrepreneurship recommendationsH7The\\tfuture\\tof\\tArtificial\\tIntelligence\\t(AI)\\tin\\tAustralia\\t|\\t55\\nThe need to develop smart cities necessarily requires piloting of new AI technology at a sufficient scale - Fisherman’s Bend as a new development area might allow for incorporation of new AI technology into developments as well as pilot programs. Some reasons that Fisherman’s Bend might be a good opportunity to act as a central  AI Precinct include the following considerations:•  Given that it is in development, it means that infrastructure, housing and other development in the area can incorporate new, embedded technologies that can be trialled in a  contained environment. •  The area is a mixed-use of commercial (including Port of Melbourne freight), housing, academic, entertainment and cultural spaces. The interactivity of technologies in a mixed-use context can also  be trialled. •  The area is also one of the largest precinct developments in the world, and therefore could lead the way globally for trialling AI technologies. Blueprints could feasibly be developed for suitable implementation of AI in the physical contexts that can be scaled globally.•  Fisherman’s Bend’s close proximity to Melbourne’s CBD should make it an attractive place for overseas investment and attraction of skills.•  It provides an opportunity to build a world-class area specifically designed for interdisciplinary collaboration (see Section 5G(d)).This precinct would need to have a plan for development which would then provide the certainty for private investment into the area. It may therefore offer specific incentives (e.g. financial and other kinds) for R&D and investment from the private sector into the precinct. It would also be important to ensure a talent pool is encouraged into the area and across Victoria, and therefore incentives for attracting and retaining AI talent into the area (e.g. taxation, financial, training etc) might also be considered. It might also house the NCAIEI – making Victoria the leading centre for  AI in Australia.     Recommendation oo: Victorian Government to develop a feasibility study on an AI Precinct(s) and to consider the location, timing and how to establish this Precinct, with the understanding that different precincts offer different, unique opportunities to learn. d)  Fostering and enabling interdisciplinary collaborationThe most innovative solutions typically emerge  when multiple industries or disciplines are combined or come together. While such collaboration can  be serendipitous, this serendipity can, and  arguably should, also be engineered – at any  and all scales possible. At the small end, initiatives fostering such collaboration can include events and workshops, inviting a wide range of participants and drawing on Melbourne’s diverse skillset, integrating the expertise of other disciplines already well presented in the city. At the large end, the development of an AI Precinct could act as a significant catalyst; at best, it could provide for the development of AI-enhanced future societies, the equivalent of the Francis Crick Institute (a renowned biomedical research facility in London, purpose-built to foster interdisciplinary collaboration), albeit such an ambitious a goal would require significant funding.     Recommendation pp: Victorian Government to develop an AI Precinct with cross-industry and interdisciplinary collaboration as a design guideline. e) Promote necessary culture changesWhile the birthplace of many significant innovations, Australia is known globally for its risk-averse nature rather than risk-taking. This ingrained cultural feature, while appropriate in some domains, holds the country back from adopting and developing many cutting-edge technologies and solutions. The government has a role to play in shaping the culture towards one where entrepreneurship and appropriate measured risk-taking in general is not only accepted but celebrated.

Digital platforms and technologies that utilise user data to provide personalised products or services have proliferated across communities and industries.  At the same time, data analysis has been widely recognised for its value as fuel for innovation that can benefit the community in unprecedented ways, including identifying gaps in services, revealing needs for new or different products, and enabling better-informed policy-making.  In this environment, the success of an organisation that handles personal information or a project that involves personal information depends on trust. People have to trust that their privacy is protected, and be confident that personal information will be handled in line with their expectations.  As we’ve found in our long-running national community attitudes to privacy survey, if an organisation does not demonstrate a commitment to privacy, people will look for alternative suppli ers, products, and services. One of the biggest risks organisations face in this context is a data breach. A data breach involving personal information can put affected individuals at risk of serious harm and consequently damage an organisation’s reputation as a data custodian. However, it is important to recognise that consumer and community trust is not necessarily extinguished immediately after a data breach occurs. After all, history has shown us that even organisations with great information security can fall victim to a data breach, due to the rapid evolution of data security threats and the difficulty of removing the risk of human error in large and complex organisations.  When a data breach occurs, a quick and effective response can have a positive impact on people’s perceptions of an organisation’s trustworthiness. That is why being prepared for a data breach is important for all organisations that handle personal information.  By an ‘effective’ response to a data breach, I mean a response that succes sfully reduces or removes the risk of harm to individuals, and which aligns with legislative requirements and community expectations.  This guide aims to assist you in developing and implementing an effective data breach response. It outlines the requirements relating to data breaches in the Privacy Act 1988  (Cth) (Privacy Act), including personal information security requirements and the mandatory data breach reporting obligations of the Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme. The guide also covers other key considerations in developing a robust data breach response strategy, including the key steps to take when a breach occurs, the capabilities of staff, and governance processes. While this guide is primarily for Australian Government agencies and private s ector organisations with obligations under the Privacy Act, the information provided is useful to any organisation operating in Australia. Taken holistically, the information provided in this guide provides a framework for meeting expectations for accountability and transparency in data breach prevention and management, which is key to maintaining and building consumer and community trust.

The guide is in five parts. Part 1: Data breaches and the Australian Privacy Act  This section outlines the requirements of the Privacy Act that relate to personal information security and data breach response strategy. The  principles contained within the Privacy Act for the handling of personal information may be adopted by any entity to lower the risk of a data breach occurring and to effectively reduce the impact of a data breach.  Part 2: Preparing a data breach response plan The faster an entity responds to a data breach, the more likely it is to effectively limit any negative consequences. A data breach response plan is essential to facilitate a swift response and ensure that any legal obligations are met following a data breach. Part 3: Responding to data breaches — Four key steps An effective data breach response generally follows a four -step process — contain, assess, notify, and review. This section outlines key considerations for each of these steps to assist entities in preparing an effective data breach response.  Part 4: Notifiable Data Breaches This section outlines the requirements of the NDB scheme under the Privacy Act. The NDB scheme contains mandatory data breach reporting obligations in relation to certain data breaches, and requirements to assess suspected data breaches.  Part 5: Other sources of information The obligations of the Privacy Act in relation to data breaches co -exist with other reporting obligations. This section assists entities in identifying where they can find information about other data breach reporting requirements. \\nWho should use this guide? \\nAny entity that handles personal information can use this guide to inform their preparation and response strategy for a data breach. However, this guide is primarily targeted at entities that have obligations under the Privacy Act to protect personal information. These entities are required to take reasonable steps to protect the personal information that they hold, and may be required to n otify affected individuals and the Australian Information Commissioner (Commissioner) of a data breach under the NDB scheme.  \\nHow to use this guide \\nDifferent parts of this guide will be of greater or lesser relevance to different entities depending on their goals. Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n6 oaic.gov.au Entities seeking a greater understanding of the Privacy Act , specifically in how the Privacy Act’s requirements relate to personal information security and data breach management responsibilities, should refer primarily to Part 1 and Part 4.  Entities that want to prepare a data breach response strategy , or review the effectiveness of their current response plan, should refer primarily to Part 2 and Part 3.  Entities that have experienced a data breach  can refer to Part 3 to understand the main components of an effective data breach response. They should also refer to Part 4, as it provides guidance on the mandatory data breach reporting and assessment requirements of the NDB scheme.  \\nA cautionary note \\nThere is no ‘one size fits all’ solution to prepar ing for and responding to data breaches. This guide does not provide detailed information about the systems or processes an entity may put in place to manage data breaches. Further, this guide does not provide detailed information about other obligations t hat may apply to entities in addition to the Privacy Act. Entities should consider their privacy obligations alongside other relevant legal requirements and standards.  The guide does not constitute or replace legal advice on obligations under the Privacy A ct. It is published by the Commissioner to provide general information to help entities meet the requirements of the Privacy Act. Entities are encouraged to seek professional advice tailored to their own circumstances where required.                  Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n7 oaic.gov.au Part 1: Data breaches and the Australian Privacy Act \\nKey points \\n• A data breach is an unauthorised access or disclosure of personal information, or loss of personal information. • Data breaches can have serious consequences, so it is important that entities ha ve robust systems and procedures in place to identify and respond effectively.  • Entities that are regulated by the Privacy Act should be familiar with the requirements of the NDB scheme, which are an extension of their information governance and security ob ligations. • A data breach incident may also trigger reporting obligations outside of the Privacy Act.  \\nWhat is a data breach? \\nA data breach occurs when personal information that an entity holds is subject to unauthorised access or disclosure, or is lost.  Personal information is information about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable.\\n1 Entities should be aware that information that is not about an individual on its own can become personal information when it is combined wit h other information, if this combination results in an individual becoming ‘reasonably identifiable’ as a result.  A data breach may be caused by malicious action (by an external or insider party), human error, or a failure in information handling or securi ty systems.  Examples of data breaches include: • loss or theft of physical devices (such as laptops and storage devices) or paper records that contain personal information • unauthorised access to personal information by an employee  • inadvertent disclosure of personal information due to ‘human error’, for example an email sent to the wrong person • disclosure of an individual’s personal information to a scammer, as a result of inadequate identity verification procedures. \\nConsequences of a data breach \\nData breaches can cause significant harm in multiple ways.    \\n                                                                    \\n1  Section 6 of the Privacy Act. For detailed information about the scope of ‘personal information’, see What is personal information?, OAIC website <https://www.oaic.gov.au>. Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n8 oaic.gov.au Individuals whose personal information is involved in a data breach may be at risk of serious harm, whether that is harm to their physical or mental well -being, financial loss, or damage to their reputation.  Examples of harm include: • financial fraud including unauthorised credit card transactions or credit fraud  • identity theft causing financial loss or emotional and psychological harm  • family violence • physical harm or intimidation. A data breach can also negatively impact an entity’s reputation for privacy protection, and as a result undercut an entity’s commercial interests. As shown in the OAIC’s long -running national community attitudes to privacy survey, privacy protection contributes to an individual’s trust in an entity.\\n 2 If an entity is perceived to be handling personal information contrary to community expectations, individuals may seek out alternative products and services.  An entity can reduce the reputational impact of a data breach by effectively minimising the risk of harm to affected individuals, and by demonstrating accountability in their data breach response. This involves being transparent when a data breach, wh ich is likely to cause serious harm to affected individuals, occurs. Transparency enables individuals to take steps to reduce their risk of harm. It also demonstrates that an entity takes their responsibility to protect personal information seriously, which is integral to building and maintaining trust in an entity’s personal information handling capability. \\nThe Australian Privacy Principles \\nThe Privacy Act contains 13 Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) that set out entities’ obligations for the management of personal information. The APPs are principles -based and technologically neutral; they outline principles for how personal information is handled and these principles may be applied across different technologies and uses of personal information over time.  Compliance with the APPs as a whole will reduce the risk of a data breach occurring. This is because the APPs ensure that privacy risks are reduced or removed at each stage of personal information handling, including collection, storage, use, disclosur e, and destruction of personal information. For example, APP 3 restricts the collection of personal information. APPs 4.3 and 11.2 outline requirements to destroy or de-identify information if it is unsolicited or no longer needed by the entity. Compliance with these requirements reduces the amount of data that may be exposed as a result of a breach. Compliance with the requirement to secure personal information in APP 11 is key to minimising the risk of a data breach.\\n3 APP 11 requires entities to take reasonable steps to protect the personal information they hold from misuse, interference and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. The type of steps that are reasonable to protect information will \\n                                                                    \\n2  See the Australian Community Attitudes to Privacy surveys at Research, OAIC website < https://www.oaic.gov.au>. \\n3  Sections 20Q and 21S of the Privacy Act impose equivalent obligations on credit reporting agencies and all credit \\nproviders. Similarly, the Privacy (Tax File Num ber) Rule 2015 <https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2015L00249> \\nmade under s 17 of the Privacy Act  requires TFN recipients to take reasonable steps to protect TFN information from \\nmisuse and loss, and from unauthorised access, use, modification or disc losure.  Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n9 oaic.gov.au depend on the circumstances of the entity and the risks associated with personal information \\nhandled by the entity.4 In addition, APP 1 requires entities to take reasonable steps to establish and maintain practices, procedures, and systems to ensure compliance with the APPs.\\n5 The OAIC has published various resources to assist entities to meet their obligations under APP 1.2\\n6 and APP 11.\\n7  \\nThe Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme \\nThe NDB scheme in Part IIIC of the Privacy Act requires entities to notify affected individuals and the Commissioner of certain data breaches. The NDB scheme requires entities to notify individuals and the Commissioner about ‘eligible data breaches’. An eligible data breach occurs when the following criteria are met:  •There is unauthorised access to or disclosure of personal information held by an entity (orinformation is lost in circumstances where unauthorised access or disclosure is likely tooccur).•This is likely to result in serious harm to any of the individuals to whom the informationrelates.•The entity has been unable to prevent the likely risk of serious harm with remedial action.Entities must also conduct an assessment if it is not clear if a suspected data breach meets these criteria. The assessment will determine whether the breach is an ‘eligible data breach’ that triggers notification obligations. The primary purpose of the NDB scheme is to ensure individuals are notified if their personal information is involved in a data breach that is likely to result in serious harm. This has a practical function: once notified about a data breach, individuals can take steps to reduce their risk of harm. For example, an individual can change passwords to compromised online accounts, and be alert to identity fraud or scams. The NDB scheme also serves the broader purpose of enhancing entities’ accountability for privacy protection. By demonstrating that entities are accountable for privacy, and that breaches of privacy are taken seriously, the NDB scheme works to build trust in personal information handling across industries.  Part 4 of this guide provides detailed information to assist entities to meet their obligations under Part IIIC of the Privacy Act when responding to an eligible data breach or a suspected eligible data breach.   \\n4S ee Chapter 11 of the APP Guidelines and the Guide to Securing Personal Information on the OAIC website <https://www.oaic.gov.au>. \\n5A similar requirement applies to credit reporting bodies in s 20B(2), to take reasonable steps to implement pra ctices, \\nprocedures and s ystems to ensure compliance with the credit reporting obligations in Part IIIA of the Privacy Act and the \\nPrivacy (Credit Reporting) Code 2014 (Version 2 .1) <https://www.legislatio n.gov.au/Details/F202 0L00126>.  \\n6See Privacy Management Framework , Privacy Management Plan Template (for Organisations), Interactive Privacy Management Plan (for Agencies), and Chapter 1 of the APP Guidelines on the OAIC website <https://www.oaic.gov.au>.  \\n7S ee Chapter 11 of the APP Guidelines and t he Guide to Securing Personal Information on the OAIC website <https://www.oaic.gov.au>. Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n10 oaic.gov.au Other obligations \\nEntities may have other obligations outside of those contained in the Privacy Act that relate to personal information protection and responding to a data breach. These may include other data protection obligations under state-based or international data protection laws. Australian  businesses may need to comply with the European Union’s (EU’s) General Data Protection  Regulation (GDPR)\\n8 if they have an establishment in the EU, if they offer goods and services in the EU, or if they monitor the behaviour of individuals in the EU.  For data breaches affecting certain categories of information, other mandatory or voluntary reporting schemes may exist. For example, entities might consider reporting certain breaches to:  • the entity’s financial services provider • police or law enforcement bodies • the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC)  • the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA)  • the Australian Taxation Office (ATO)  • the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC)  • the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) • the Australian Digital Health Agency (ADHA)  • the Department of Health • State or Territory Privacy and Information Commissioners  • professional associations and regulatory bodies  • insurance providers. Other resources are listed in Part 5 of this guide. Some entities may have additional obligations to report to the Commissioner under the National Cancer Screening Register Act 2016 (NCSR Act) or have different reporting obligations under the My Health Records Act 2012 (My Health Records Act).  Under the NCSR Act, current and former contracted service providers of the National Cancer Screening Register must notify the Secretary of the Department of Health (the Secretary) and the Commissioner if they become aware of unauthorised recording, use or disclosure of  personal information included in the Register. The Secretary must also notify the Commissioner of certain data breaches, including potential breaches, in connection with the National Cancer Screening Register. The Secretary must also consult the Information Commissioner about notifying individuals who may be affected. Separately, entities with NCSR Act obligations must consider whether the incident also requires notification under the NDB scheme, as the two schemes operate concurrently. Where the test for both schemes have been met, the entity may make a joint notification to the Commissioner.  \\n                                                                    \\n8  The OAIC’s Australian Entities and the E U General Data Protection Regulation  may assist Australian businesses to understand and comply with the GDPR’s requirements.  Further guidance is also available from the Article 29 Working Group <http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/news.cfm?item_type=1360&tpa_id=6936 >. Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n11 oaic.gov.au Certain participants in the My Health Record system (such as the System Operator, a registered healthcare provider organisation, a registered repository operator, a registered portal operator or a registered contracted service provider), are required to report data breaches that occur in relation to the My Health Record system to the either the System Operator or the Commissioner, or both, depending on the entity reporting the data breach (s 75 of the My Health Records Act ). More information about obligations under the My Health Records Act and how these obligations interact with the NDB scheme is available in Part 4.  \\n Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n12 oaic.gov.au Part 2: Preparing a data breach response plan \\nKey points \\n• A quick response to a data breach, based on an up -to-date data breach response plan, is critical to effectively managing a breach  • your data breach response plan should outline your entity’s strategy for containing, assessing and managing the incident from start to finish  • this part will provide practical guidance to help you develop a comprehensive and effective data breach response plan. \\nWhy do you need a data breach response plan? \\nAll entities should have a data breach response plan. A data breach response plan enables an entity to respond quickly to a data breach. By responding quickly, an entity can substantially decrease the impact of a breach on affected individuals, reduc e the costs associated with dealing with a breach, and reduce the potential reputational damage that can result.  A data breach response plan can help you:  • Meet your obligations under the Privacy Act  Under the Privacy Act, an entity must take reasonable steps to protect the personal information that it holds.\\n9 A data breach response plan focussed on reducing the impact of a breach can be one of these reasonable steps.  • Limit the consequences of a data breach  A quick response can reduce the likelihood of affected individuals suffering harm. It can also lessen financial or reputational damage to the entity that experienced the breach.  • Preserve and build public trust An effective data breach response can support consumer and public confidence in an  entity’s respect for individual privacy, and the entity’s ability to manage personal information in accordance with community expectations.  \\nWhat is a data breach response plan? \\nA data breach response plan is a framework that sets out the roles and respons ibilities involved in managing a data breach. It also describes the steps an entity will take if a data breach occurs.  Your data breach response plan should be in writing to ensure that your staff clearly understand what needs to happen in the event of a data breach. It is also important for staff to be aware of where they can access the data breach response plan on short notice.  \\n                                                                    \\n9  An APP entity is required under s 15 not to do an act, or engage in a practice, that breaches APP 11.1; a credit reporting body is required to comply with s 20Q in relation to credit reporting information; a credit provider is re quired to comply with s 21S(1) in relation to  credit eligibility information; a file number recipient is required under s 18 not to do an \\nact, or engage in a practice, that breaches  the Privacy (Tax File Number) Rule 2015  \\n<https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2015L00249 >. Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n13 oaic.gov.au You will need to regularly review and test your plan to make sure it is up to date and that your staff know what actions they are expected to take. You can test your plan by, for example, responding to a hypothetical data breach and reviewing how your response could be made more effective.  How regularly you test your plan will depend on your circumstances, including the size of yo ur entity, the nature of your operations, the possible adverse consequences to an individual if a breach occurs, and the amount and sensitivity of the information you hold. It may be appropriate in some instances that a review of the plan coincides with th e introduction of new products, services, system enhancements, or such other events which involve the handling of personal information. \\nWhat should the plan cover? \\nThe more comprehensive your data breach response plan is, the better prepared your entity wi ll be to effectively reduce the risks and potential damage that can result.  Information that your plan should cover includes:  • A clear explanation of what constitutes a data breach  This will assist your staff in identifying a data breach should one occur ( see What is a Data Breach? section above). You may also want to include potential examples of a data breach which are tailored to reflect your business activities. • A strategy for containing, assessing and managing data breaches  This strategy should include the actions your staff, and your response team, will take in the event of a data breach or a suspected data breach. Consider:  \\no potential strategies for containing and remediating data breaches  \\no ensuring you have the capability to implement those strategies as a matter of priority (e.g. having staff available to deal with the breach –  see Response Team Membership section below). Your plan should reflect the capabilities of your staff to adequately assess data breaches and their impact, especially when breaches are not escalated to a response team  \\no legislative or contractual requirements (such as the requirements of the NDB scheme if they apply to your entity) \\no a clear and immediate communications strategy that allows for the prompt notification of affected individuals and other relevant entities. In partic ular: \\uf0a7 who is responsible for implementing the communications strategy  \\uf0a7 determining when affected individuals must be notified (refer to Identifying Eligible Data Breaches for further information about mandatory data breach notification requirements under the NDB scheme) \\uf0a7 how affected individuals will be contacted and managed  \\uf0a7 criteria for determining which external stakeholders should be contacted (for example, law enforcement and cyber security agencies, regulators such as the OAIC, and the media) \\uf0a7 who is responsible for liaising with external stakeholders.  Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n14 oaic.gov.au • The roles and responsibilities of staff Your plan should outline the responsibilities of staff members when there is a data breach, or a suspected data breach. Consider: \\no who staff should inform immediately if they suspect a data breach \\no the circumstances in which a line manager can handle a data breach, and when a data breach must be escalated to the response team. The following factors may determine when a data breach is escalated to the response team:  \\uf0a7 the number of people affected by the breach or suspected breach   \\uf0a7 whether there is a risk of serious harm to af fected individuals now or in the future  \\uf0a7 whether the data breach or suspected data breach may indicate a systemic problem with your entity’s practices or procedures  \\uf0a7 other issues relevant to your circumstances, such as the value of the data to you or issues of reputational risk. \\no who is responsible for deciding whether the breach should be escalated to the response team. One option is for each senior manager to hold responsibility for deciding when to escalate a data breach to the response team. Another optio n is to have a dedicated role, such as the privacy contact officer. • Documentation  Your plan should consider how your entity will record data breach incidents, including those that are not escalated to the response team. This will assist you in ensuring yo u have documentation of how your entity has met regulatory requirements.  • Review Evaluating how a data breach occurred, and the success of your response, can help you improve your data handling and data breach management. Consider:  \\no a strategy to identify and address any weaknesses in data handling that contributed to the breach \\no a system for a post-breach assessment of your entity’s response to the data breach and the effectiveness of your data breach response plan.  \\nResponse team membership \\nYour data breach response team is responsible for carrying out the actions that can reduce the potential impact of a data breach. It is important that the staff that make up the response team, as well as their roles and responsibilities, are clearly established and document ed before a data breach occurs. Otherwise, your response to the breach may be unnecessarily delayed. Who is in your data breach response team will depend on the circumstances of your entity and the nature of the breach. Different skill sets and staff may b e needed to respond to one breach compared to another. In some cases, you may need to include external experts in your team, for example legal advice, data forensics, or media management. You should identify the types of expertise you may need and ensure that this expertise will be available on short notice. You might consider creating a core team and adding other members as they are required.  Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n15 oaic.gov.au You should keep a current list of response team members and clearly detail their roles, responsibilities, and authorities, as well as their contact details (possibly attached to the data breach response plan). You should ensure these contact details remain updated, particularly in the event of organisational changes. Each role on the response team should have a second point of contact in case the first person is not available.  \\nTypical data breach response team roles and skills  \\nYour data breach response team may include:  • a team leader — who is responsible for leading the response team and reporting to senior management • a project manager — to coordinate the team and provide support to its members  • a senior member of staff with overall accountability for privacy and/or key privacy officer — to bring privacy expertise to the team • legal support — to identify legal obligations and provide advice  • risk management support — to assess the risks from the breach • Information and Communication Technology (ICT) support/forensics support —  this role can help establish the cause and impact of a data breach that involved ICT sys tems • information and records management expertise –  to assist in reviewing security and monitoring controls related to the breach (for example, access, authentication, encryption, audit logs) and to provide advice on recording the response to the data brea ch • human resources (HR) support — if the breach was due to the actions of a staff member  • media/communications expertise — to assist in communicating with affected individuals and dealing with the media and external stakeholders.  If you hold an insurance policy for data breaches, that insurer may have a pre -established panel of external service providers in many of the roles listed above. You may want to consult with your insurer as to the identity of that panel so they can be included in any response team. Alternatively, the insurer may have a hotline available to assist in the event of a data breach, and that could be noted in the response plan. Which individuals carry out the roles outlined in your response team will depend on your circumstances. For example, in smaller entities it may not be necessary to include steps related to escalating the data breach to the response team, as this may be an automatic process. Depending on the size of your entity or the size of the breach, a single person may perform mu ltiple roles. In smaller entities the owner/principal of the entity could potentially be the person who needs to respond to and act on that breach. It is important that the response team has the authority to take the steps outlined in the response plan without needing to seek permission, as this will enable a faster response to the breach. The role of team leader should be carefully considered, as they should have sufficient ability and authority to effectively manage the various sections within the entity whose input is required and to report to senior management. It may be your senior member of staff with overall accountability for privacy, a senior lawyer (if you have an internal legal function) or another senior manager. If the breach is serious, it may be a senior executive.  Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n16 oaic.gov.au Actions the response team should take \\nA data breach response plan should also set out (or refer to) the actions the response team is expected to take when a data breach is discovered. Part 3 of this Guide provides a general framework for responding to a data breach, and Part 4 outlines the requirements of the NDB scheme, which may apply to your entity if they have personal information security obligations under the Privacy Act.   The response team will need to consider what informatio n needs to be reported to senior management and at what point. This reporting structure should form part of the plan.  The data breach response plan should outline how staff will record how they have become aware of a data breach and the actions taken in re sponse. Keeping records on data breaches and suspected breaches will help you manage the breach and identify risks that could make a breach more likely to occur. \\nOther considerations \\nIn developing your plan you could also consider:  • when and how the response team could practice a response to a breach in order to test procedures and refine them • whether your plan for dealing with personal information data breaches could link into or be incorporated into already existing processes, such as a disaster recovery p lan, a cyber security/ICT incident response plan, a crisis management plan or an existing data breach response plan involving other types of information (e.g. commercially confidential information) • whether senior management should be directly involved in t he planning for dealing with data breaches and in responding to serious data breaches  • any reporting obligations under laws other than the Privacy Act or to other entities  • whether you have an insurance policy for data breaches that includes steps you must follow.   \\n Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n17 oaic.gov.au Data breach response plan quick checklist \\nUse this list to check whether your response plan addresses relevant issues.  \\nInformation to be included  Yes/No  Comments  \\nWhat a data breach is and how staff can identify one      \\nClear escalation procedures and reporting lines for suspected data \\nbreaches      \\nMembers of the data breach response team, including roles, reporting \\nlines and responsibilities      \\nDetails of any external expertise that should be engaged in particular \\ncircumsta nces      \\nHow the plan will apply to various types of data breaches and varying \\nrisk profiles with consideration of possible remedial actions      \\nAn approach for conducting assessments      \\nProcesses that outline when and how individuals are notified      \\nCircumstances in which law enforcement , regulators (such as the OAIC) , \\nor other entities  may need to be contacted      \\nProcesses for responding to incidents that involve another entity      \\n A record -keeping policy to ensure that breaches are documented      \\nRequirements under agreements with third parties such as insurance \\npolicies or service agreements      \\nA strategy identifying and addressing any weaknesses in data handling \\nthat contributed to the breach      \\nRegular reviewing and testing of the plan      \\nA system for a post -breach review and assessment of the data breach  \\nresponse and the effectiveness of the data breach response plan      \\n      \\n Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n18 oaic.gov.au Part 3: Responding to data breaches — Four key steps  \\nKey points \\n• Each data breach response needs to be tailored to the circumstances of the incident.  • In general, a data breach response should follow four key steps: contain, assess, notify and review.  \\nOverview \\nData breaches can be caused or exacerbated by a variety of factors, involve different types of personal information, and give rise to a range of actual or potential harms to individuals and entities. As such, there is no single way of responding to a data breach. Each breach w ill need to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, with an understanding of the risks posed by a breach and the actions that would be most effective in reducing or removing these risks.  Generally, the actions taken following a data breach should follow fo ur key steps: Step 1: Contain the data breach to prevent any further compromise of personal information.  Step 2: Assess the data breach by gathering the facts and evaluating the risks, including potential harm to affected individuals and, where possible, taking action to remediate any risk of harm.  Step 3: Notify individuals and the Commissioner if required. If the breach is an ‘eligible data breach’ under the NDB scheme, it may be mandatory for the entity to notify.  Step 4: Review the incident and consider what actions can be taken to prevent future breaches.  At any time, entities should take remedial action, where possible, to limit the impact of the breach on affected individuals. If remedial action is successful in preventing a likely risk of serious harm to individuals, the NDB scheme notification obligations may not apply.  In general, entities should: • take each data breach or suspected data breach seriously and move immediately to contain, assess and remediate the incident. Breaches that may initially seem immaterial may be significant when their full implications are assessed  • undertake steps 1 (Contain), 2 (Assess), and 3 (Notify) either simultaneously or in quick succession. In some cases it may be appropriate to notify individuals immediately, before containment or assessment of the breach occurs  • determine how to respond on a case-by-case basis. Depending on the breach, not all steps may be necessary, or some steps may be combined. In some cases, an entity may take additional steps that are specific to the nature of the breach.  The following diagram summarises the data breach response process. The parts of this process that are required by the NDB scheme are coloured red. The NDB scheme is explained in detail in Part 4 of this guide. Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n19 oaic.gov.au  \\nData breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n20 oaic.gov.au Step 1: Contain \\nOnce an entity has discovered or suspects that a data breach has occurred, it should immediately take action to limit the breach.  For example, stop the unauthorised practice, recover the records, or shut down the system that was breached. If it is not practical to shut down the system, or if it would result in loss of evidence, then revoke or change computer access privileges or address weaknesses in phys ical or electronic security. Addressing the following questions may help you identify strategies to contain a data breach:  • How did the data breach occur? • Is the personal information still being shared, disclosed, or lost without authorisation?  • Who has access to the personal information? • What can be done to secure the information, or stop the unauthorised access or disclosure, and reduce the risk of harm to affected individuals?  At this point, an entity may suspect an eligible data breach under the NDB schem e has occurred, which would trigger assessment obligations.  Or, the entity may believe the data breach is an eligible data breach, which requires them to notify  individuals as soon as practicable. During this preliminary stage, be careful not to destroy evidence that may be valuable in identifying the cause of the breach, or that would enable the entity to address all risks posed to affected individuals or the entity.  \\nStep 2: Assess \\nAn assessment of the data breach can help an entity understand the risks posed by a data breach and how these risks can be addressed. It should be conducted as expeditiously as possible.  Gather and evaluate as much information about the data breach as possible. By creating a complete picture of the data breach, an entity  can ensure they understand the risk of harm to affected individuals, and identify and take all appropriate steps to limit the impact of a data breach.  This assessment should also assist entities in deciding whether affected individuals must be notified. In your assessment of a data breach, consider:  • the type or types of personal information involved i n the data breach • the circumstances of the data breach, including its cause and extent • the nature of the harm to affected individuals, and if this harm can be removed through remedial action. All entities should consider whether remedial action can be taken to reduce any potent ial harm to individuals. This might also take place during Step 1: Contain, such as by recovering lost information before it is accessed. Entities subject to the NDB scheme are required to conduct an assessment  of ‘suspected’ eligible data breaches and take reasonable steps to complete this assessment within 30 days (see Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n21 oaic.gov.au Assessing a Suspected Data Breach). Criteria for assessing a data breach, including the risk of harm and remedial action, is explored in Identifying Eligible Data Breaches. \\nStep 3: Notify  \\nNotification can be an important mitigation strategy that has the potential to benefit both the entity and the individuals affected by a data br each. The challenge is to determine when notification is appropriate. Sometimes, notifying individuals can cause undue stress or harm. For example, notifying individuals about a data breach that poses very little or no risk of harm can cause unnecessary anxiety. It can also de -sensitise individuals so that they don’t take a notification seriously, even when there is a real risk of serious harm. Each incident needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis to determine whether breach notification is required.  Consider:  • the obligations of the entity under the NDB scheme. Entities are required to notify individuals and the Commissioner about data breaches that are likely to result in serious harm. Part 4 of this guide provides further detail about the NDB schem e’s requirements • other circumstances in which individuals should be notified. For example, your entity may not have obligations under the NDB scheme, but have processes in place to notify affected individuals in certain circumstances • how notification should occur, including: \\no what information is provided in the notification  \\no how the notification will be provided to individuals  \\no who is responsible for notifying individuals and creating the notification.  • who else other than affected individuals (and the Commissioner if the notification obligations of the NDB scheme apply) should be notified  • where a law enforcement agency is investigating the breach, it may be appropriate to consult the investigating agency before making details of the breach public  • whether the incident triggers reporting obligations to other entities. Effective data breach response is about reducing or removing harm to affected individuals, while protecting the interests of your organisation or agency. Notification has the practical benefit of providing individuals with the opportunity to take steps to protect their personal information following a data breach, such as by changing account passwords or being alert to possible scams resulting from the breach. It is important that staff are capable of  engaging with individuals who have been affected by a data breach with sensitivity and compassion, in order not to exacerbate or cause further harm. Notification can also help build trust in an entity, by demonstrating that privacy protection is taken seriously. \\nStep 4: Review \\nOnce steps 1 to 3 have been completed, an entity should review and learn from the data breach incident to improve its personal information handling practices.  This might involve: • a security review including a root cause analysis of t he data breach Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n22 oaic.gov.au • a prevention plan to prevent similar incidents in future  • audits to ensure the prevention plan is implemented  • a review of policies and procedures and changes to reflect the lessons learned from the review  • changes to employee selection and training practices  • a review of service delivery partners that were involved in the breach.  In reviewing information management and data breach response, an entity can refer to the OAIC’s Guide to Securing Personal Information.\\n10 When reviewing a data breach incident, it is important to use the lessons learned to strengthen the entity’s personal information security and handling practices, and to reduce the chance of reoccurrence. A data breach should be considered alongside any si milar breaches that have occurred in the past, which could indicate a systemic issue with policies or procedures.  If any updates are made following a review, staff should be trained in any changes to relevant policies and procedures to ensure a quick resp onse to a data breach.   \\n                                                                    \\n10  See Guide to Securing Personal Information , OAIC website <https://www.oaic.gov.au>.  Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n23 oaic.gov.au Part 4: Notifiable Data Breach (NDB) Scheme  \\nThe Privacy Act requires certain entities to notify individuals and the Commissioner about data breaches that are likely to cause serious harm.   The requirements of the NDB scheme are c ontained in Part IIIC of the Privacy Act and apply to breaches that occur on or after 22 February 2018.  This part of the guide covers the following topics:  • Entities covered by the NDB scheme • Data breaches involving more than one entity  • Identifying eligible data breaches • Exceptions to the notification obligation  • Assessing a suspected data breach • Notifying individuals about an eligible data breach  • What to include in an eligible data breach statement  • The Australian Information Commissioner's role in the NDB sc heme.  \\n Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n24 oaic.gov.au Entities covered by the NDB scheme \\nKey points \\n• Entities that have existing obligations under the Privacy Act to secure personal information must comply with the NDB scheme. • This includes Australian Government agencies, businesses and not -for profit organisations that have an annual turnover of more than AU $3 million, private sector health service providers, credit reporting bodies, credit providers, entities that trade in personal information and tax file number (TFN) recipients. • Entities that have Privacy Act security obligations in relation to particular types of information only (for example, small businesses that are required to secure tax file number information) do not need to notify about data breaches that affect other types of information outside the scope of their obligations under the Privacy Act.  \\nAPP entities \\nThe NDB scheme applies to entities that have an obligation under APP 11 of the Privacy Act to protect the personal information they ho ld (s 26WE(1)(a)).\\n11 Collectively known as ‘APP entities’, these include Australian Government agencies and private sector and not-for-profit organisations with an annual turnover of more than $3 million. The definition of APP entity generally does not include small business operators, registered political parties, state or territory authorities, or a prescribed instrumentality of a state (s 6C). However, some businesses of any size are APP entities, including businesses that trade in personal information\\n12 and organisations that provide a health service to, and hold health information about, individuals (see What Is a Health Service Provider?).\\n13 For more information about APP entities, see Chapter B of the Australian Priva cy Principle Guidelines (APP Guidelines).\\n14  Exempt acts and practices, including employee records  The NDB scheme only applies to entities and personal information holdings that are already subject to security requirements under the Privacy Act. This means that acts and practices of APP entities that are exempt from the Privacy Act will also be exempt from the NDB scheme.  For example, in some circumstances, private sector employers do not have to comply with the APPs in relation to employee records ass ociated with current and former employment relationships (s 7B(3)). If an exempt employee record is subject to unauthorised access, disclosure or loss, the private sector employer does not have to assess the breach or notify individuals and the Commissioner. This exemption does not apply to TFN information that is contained within an employee record. However, given community expectations around the handling of their personal \\n                                                                    \\n11  ‘Personal information’ is defined in s 6(1) of the Privacy Act to include information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable, whether the information or opinion is true or not, and whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.  \\n12  See Trading in Personal Information, OAIC website <https://www.oaic.gov.au>.  \\n13  See What Is a Health Service Provider? , OAIC website <https://www.oaic.gov.au>.  \\n14  See APP Guidelines, Chapter B: Key Concepts, section ‘APP entity’, OAIC website <https://www.oaic.gov.au>.  Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n25 oaic.gov.au information, it is recommended that employers notify affected individuals where a b reach of an employee record is likely to result in serious harm. Doing so will enable affected individuals to take protective action against any potential harms, as well as illustrating to employees that the security of their records is taken seriously.   Further information about acts and practices that are exempt from the APPs and, by extension, the NDB scheme can be found in Rights and Responsibilities.\\n15 \\nSmall business operators \\nA small business operator (SBO) is an individual (including a sole trader), body corporate, partnership, unincorporated association , or trust that has not had an annual turnover of more than $3 million in any financial year since 2001 (s 6D).  Generally, SBOs do not have obligations under the APPs unless an exception applies (s 6D( 4)).  In certain circumstances an SBO must comply with the APPs, and therefore with the NDB scheme. That will be the case where the SBO • holds health information and provides a health service • is related to an APP entity  \\n• trades in personal information. That is, the SBO discloses personal information about \\nindividuals to anyone else for a benefit, service or advantage; or provides a benefit, service or \\nadvantage through the collection of personal information about another individual from \\nanyone else \\n• is a credit reporting bodies • is an employee associations registered under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 • has ‘opted-in’ to APP coverage under s 6EA of the Privacy Act.  If an SBO carries on certain activities it must comply with the APPs, and ther efore must comply with the NDB scheme, but only in relation to personal information held by the entity for the purpose of, or in connection with, those activities. Those activities include:  • providing services to the Commonwealth under a contract • operating a residential tenancy data base • reporting under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006  • conducting a protected action ballot • information retained under the mandatory data retention scheme, as per Part 5 -1A of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 . \\nMore information about how to determine whether a business or organisation is an APP entity or \\nsubject to the APPs for some of its activities is available at  Small Business.16 \\n                                                                    \\n15  See Rights and Responsibilities, OAIC website <https://www.oaic.gov.au>.  \\n16  See Small Business, OAIC website <https://www.oaic.gov.au>.  Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n26 oaic.gov.au Credit reporting bodies \\nA credit reporting body (CRB) is a business or undertaking that involves collecting, holding, using , or disclosing personal information about individuals for the purpose of providing an entity with information about the credit worthiness of an individual (s 6 P). Credit reporting information is defined as credit information or CRB derived information about an individual (s 6(1)).   CRBs have obligations under the NDB scheme in relation to their handling of credit reporting information (s 26WE(1)(b)), and in relation to their handling of any other personal information for which they have obligations under APP 11.  \\nCredit providers \\nThe NDB scheme applies to all credit providers whether or not they are APP entities. T he section of the Privacy Act under which a credit provider is required to comply with the scheme will depend on what kind of information is involved in the data breach.  If it is ‘credit eligibility information’ (defined in s 6(1)) the NDB scheme will apply because of the security requirement in s 21S(1) in relation to that information.  If the credit provider is also an APP entity the NDB scheme applies in relation to other personal information because of the security requirement in APP 11.  The organisations that are credit providers for the purposes of the Privacy Act (s 6G) are: • a bank • an organisation or small business operator if a substantial part of its business is the provision of credit, such as a building society, finance company or a credit union  • a retailer that issues credit cards in connec tion with the sale of goods or services • an organisation or SBO that supplies goods and services where payment is deferred for seven  days or more, such as telecommunications carriers , and energy and water utilities • certain organisations or SBOs that provide credit in connection with the hiring, leasing , or renting of goods. An organisation or SBO that acquires the right of a credit provider in relation to the repayment of an amount of credit is also considered a credit provider, but only in relation to th at particular credit (s 6K). \\nTFN recipients \\nThe NDB scheme applies to TFN recipients17 in relation to their handling of TFN information ( s \\n26WE(1)(d)). A TFN recipient is any person who is in possession or control of a record that contains \\nTFN information (s 11). TFN information is information that connects a TFN with the identity of a \\nparticular individual (s 6). \\nA TFN recipient may also be an APP entity or credit provider. In certain circumstances, entities that \\nare not otherwise covered by the Privacy Act, such as state and local government bodies, may also \\nbe authorised to receive TFN information and will be con sidered TFN recipients.  \\n                                                                    \\n17  Referred to in the Privacy Act and Privacy (Tax File Number) Rule 2015 as ‘file number recipients’.  Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n27 oaic.gov.au The NDB scheme applies to TFN recipients to the extent that TFN information is involved in a data \\nbreach. If TFN information is not involved, a TFN recipient would only need to comply with the NDB \\nscheme for breaches of other types of information if they are also a credit provider or APP entity.  \\nMore information about TFN recipients is available in The Privacy (Tax File Number) Rule 2015 and the Protection of Tax File Number Information.\\n18 \\nOverseas activities \\nEntities with an ‘Australian link’ The NDB scheme generally extends to the overseas activities of an Australian Government agency (s 5B(1)). It also applies to organisations (including small businesses covered by the Act, outlined above) that have an ‘Australian link’ (s 5B(2)).  An organisation has an Australian link either because it is, in summary, incorporated or formed in Australia (see s 5B(1A) for more detail), or where:  • it carries on business in Australia or an external Territory, and  • it collected or held personal information in Australia or an external Australian Territory, either before or at the time of the act or practice (s 5B(3)).  Further information about entities that are taken to have an Australian link is available in Chapter B of the APP Guidelines.\\n19 Disclosing personal information overseas  \\nIf an APP entity discloses personal information to an overseas recipient, in line with the requirements of APP 8.1, then the APP entity is deemed to ‘hold’ the information for the purposes of the NDB scheme (s 26WC(1)). APP 8.1 says that an APP entity that discloses personal information \\nto an overseas recipient is required to ta ke reasonable steps to ensure that the overseas recipient \\ndoes not breach the APPs in relation to the information . This means that if the personal information held by the overseas recipient is subject to loss, unauthorised access, or disclosure, the APP entity is still responsible for assessing whether it is an eligible data breach under the Privacy Act, and if it is, for notifying individuals at risk of serious harm and providing a statement to the Commissioner. \\nThere are exceptions to the requirement in APP 8.1 to take reasonable steps. APP entities that disclose information overseas under an exception in APP 8.2 are not taken to ‘ hold’ information they have disclosed overseas under s 26WC.

In the event that credit eligibility information held by the person or related body corporate is subject to loss, unauthorised access, or disclosure, the credit provider is responsible for assessing whether there is an eligible data breach that needs to be notified to individuals at risk of serious harm and the Commissioner.   \\n \\n                                                                    \\n21  This section only applies to a disclosure of credit eligibility information by a credit provider to a related body corporate under s 21G(3)(b), to a person processing an application for credit made to the credit provider or to a person who manages credit provided by the credit provider under s 21G(3) or to a debt collector under s 21M(1) of the Privacy Act.  Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n29 oaic.gov.au Data breaches involving more than one entity \\nKey points \\n• The NDB scheme recognises that entities often hold personal information jointly. For example, one entity may have physical possession of the information, while another has legal control or ownership. • In these circumstances, an eligible data breach of one entity will also be considered an eligible data breach of other entities that hold the affected information. Both will have obligations under the NDB scheme.  • In general, compliance by one entity will also be taken as compliance by each of the entities that hold the information.  As such, only one entity needs to take the steps required by the NDB scheme. The NDB scheme leaves it up to the entities to decide which of them should do so. • OAIC suggests that, in general, the entity with the most direct relationship with the individuals affected by the data breach should carry out notification.  \\nWhen is information held jointly? \\nUnder s 6(1) of the Privacy Act, an entity is taken to ‘hold’ personal information if it has possession or control of a record that contains personal information. This mean s that the term ‘holds’ extends beyond physical possession of a record to include a record that an entity has a right or power to deal with, even if it does not physically possess the record or own the medium on which it is stored.  For example, one entity may store its records with a cloud service provider. Since the cloud service provider has possession of the records, it will be taken to hold  the personal information. Because the first entity has contractual rights to retain control of the records (such as maintaining rights to access and use the records), both entities hold the information.  Whether an entity will be taken to ‘hold’ personal i nformation will therefore depend on the particular circumstances of the arrangement.  Other examples where two or more entities may hold the same information include:  • outsourcing arrangements • Commonwealth contracts • joint ventures.   Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n30 oaic.gov.au   \\nExample  \\nA large market research company is conducting focus groups on behalf of its client, a fast food outlet, using a list of interviewees provided by its client for that purpose. The contractual arrangements between the market research company and the fast food outlet give the fast food outlet effective control over how the information is handled by the research company. Following the focus group sessions, all participants give consent to participate in future research projects for the research company’s other clients. The research company creates a new record containing the participant’s names and contact details. Although the record contains the same information that the market research company originally received from the fast food outlet, only the market research com pany has possession or control over the newly created record. This means that only the market research company would have NDB scheme obligations in the event of a data breach \\naffecting the newly created record.    \\n  \\nResponding to data breaches of jointly held information \\nIn situations where two or more entities hold the same record of personal information, both entities are generally responsible for complying with the NDB scheme in relation to this record.  However, exceptions apply so that only one of the entities that jointly holds information needs to comply with the NDB scheme’s assessment and notification requirements on behalf of the group. For example, if a data breach affects one or more other entities that jointly hold personal information, and one entity has assessed the suspected breach, the other entities are not required to also assess the breach (s 26WJ). If no assessment is conducted, depending on the circumstances, each entity that holds the information may be found to be in breach of the assessment requirements.  Similarly, only one entity needs to notify individuals and the Commissioner (s 26WM)  if there is an eligible data breach involving personal information jointly held by more than one entity (see Identifying Eligible Data Breaches). If none of the entities notify, then all of the entities may be found to have breached the notification requirements of the NDB scheme (s 26WL (2)).  See Exceptions to Notification Obligations for more information about the circumstances in which specific exceptions apply to entities that jointly hold information.  \\nHow to allocate responsibility for compliance \\nEach entity that holds personal information involved in an eligible data breach , should be able to demonstrate they are meeting the requirements of the NDB scheme.  The NDB scheme does not prescribe which entity should conduct an assessment of a suspected data breach, nor which entity should notify individuals and the Commissioner about an eligible data breach. This allows entities to tailor their arrangements to accommodate their particular contractual and customer relationships.  Accordingly, where information is held jointly, entities should establish clear procedures for complying with the NDB scheme when entering into service agreements or other relevant contractual arrangements. This may include considering obligations around the communication of suspected breaches, processes for conducting assessments, and responsibility for containment, remediation, and notification.  Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n31 oaic.gov.au The Commissioner suggests that, in general, the entity with the most direct relationship with the individuals at risk of serious harm may be best placed to notify. This will allow individuals to better understand the notification, and how the  eligible data breach might affect them.  \\n  \\nExample A medical practice stores paper-based patient records with a contracted storage provider. The storage provider’s premises are broken into and a number of items stolen. While the storage provider cannot immediately determine if the stolen items included the medical practice’s records, it suspects that they might have been included. Both the medical practice and the storage provider hold the records for the purpose of the Privacy Act, so both have an obligation to conduct an assessment and, if required, notif y.  Since the storage provider is more familiar with its facilities, the entities decide that the storage provider is best placed to conduct an assessment and determine if the records were stolen. Once the provider determines that the records were stolen, the medical practice assists the assessment by using its knowledge about the affected individuals to conclude that serious harm is likely. Although the storage provider’s insurance company has agreed to cover the cost of notification, the storage provider and medical practice agree that it is most appropriate that notification come from the medical practice, as the relevant individuals do not have any pre-existing relationship with the storage provider. As such, the medical practice notifies the individuals about the incident and is reimbursed by the storage provider and its insurer for the costs of notification.    \\n    \\n Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n32 oaic.gov.au Identifying eligible data breaches  \\nKey points \\n• The NDB scheme requires regulated entities to notify particular individuals and the Commissioner about ‘eligible data breaches’. A data breach is eligible if it  is likely to result in serious harm to any of the individuals to whom the  information relates.  • Whether a data breach is likely to result in serious harm requires an objective ass essment, determined from the viewpoint of a reasonable person in the entity’s position.  • Not all data breaches are eligible. For example, if an entity acts quickly to remediate a data breach, and as a result of this action the data breach is not likely to result in serious harm, there is no requirement to notify any individuals or the Commissioner. There are also exceptions to notifying in certain circumstances.  \\nEligible data breach \\nAn eligible data breach arises when the following three criteria are satisf ied: 1. there is unauthorised access to or unauthorised disclosure of personal information, or a loss of personal information, that an entity holds (see, What is a ‘Data Breach’?) 2. this is likely to result in serious harm to one or more individuals (see, Is Serious Harm Likely?), and 3. the entity has not been able to prevent the likely risk of serious harm with remedial action (see Preventing Serious Harm With Remedial Action). This document is about the threshold at which an incident is considered an ‘eligible data breach’ that will be notifiable under the scheme unless an exception applies. Assessing a S uspected Data Breach provides guidance to entities about the process to follow when carrying out an assessment of ‘whether there are reasonable grounds to suspect that there may have been an eligible data breach of the entity’ under s 26WH. What is a ‘data breach’? The first step in deciding whether an eligible data breach has occurred involves considering whether there has been a data breach; that is, unauthorised access to or unauthorised disclosure of personal information, or a loss of personal information (s 26WE(2)). The Privacy Act does not define these terms. The following analysis and examples draw o n the ordinary meaning of these words. • Unauthorised access of personal information occurs when personal information that an entity holds is accessed by someone who is not permitted to have access. This includes unauthorised access by an employee of the entity, or an independent contractor, as well as unauthorised access by an external third party (such as by hacking).   Examples of unauthorised access include:  \\no  an employee browsing sensitive customer records without any legitimate purpose  \\no a computer network being compromised by an external attacker resulting in personal information being accessed without authority.  Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n33 oaic.gov.au • Unauthorised disclosure occurs when an entity, whether intentionally or unintentionally, makes personal information accessible or visible to othe rs outside the entity and releases that information from its effective control in a way that is not permitted by the Privacy Act. This includes an unauthorised disclosure by an employee of the entity.   For example, an employee of an entity accidentally pub lishing a confidential data file containing the personal information of one or more individuals on the internet would be considered unauthorised disclosure • Loss refers to the accidental or inadvertent loss of personal information held by an entity, in circumstances where is it is likely to result in unauthorised access or disclosure.   An example is where an employee of an entity leaves personal information (including hard copy documents, unsecured computer equipment, or portable storage devices containing personal information) on public transport. Under the NDB scheme, if personal information is lost in circumstances where subsequent unauthorised access to or disclosure of the information is unlikely, there is no eligible data breach (s 26WE(2)(b )(ii)). For example, if the personal information is remotely deleted before an unauthorised person could access the information, or if the information is encrypted to a high standard making unauthorised access or disclosure unlikely, then there is no eligible data breach.  Is serious harm likely? The second step in deciding whether an eligible data breach has occurred involves deciding whether, from the perspective of a reasonable person , the data breach would be likely to result in serious harm to an individual whose personal information was part of the data breach.  For the NDB scheme a ‘reasonable person’ means a person in the entity’s position (rather than the position of an individual whose personal information was part of the data breach or any other person), who is properly informed, based on information immediately available or following reasonable inquiries or an assessment of the data breach. In general, entities are not expected to make external enquiries about the circumstances of each individual w hose information is involved in the breach. ‘Reasonable person’ is also discussed in general terms in Chapter B of the OAIC’s APP Guidelines.\\n22 The phrase ‘likely to occur’ means the risk of serious harm to an individual is more probable than not (rather than possible).  ‘Serious harm’ is not defined in the Privacy Act. In the context of a data breach, serious harm  to an individual may include serious physical, psychological, emotional, financial , or reputational harm. Entities should assess the risk of serious harm holistically, having regard to the likelihood of the harm eventuating for individuals whose personal information wa s part of the data breach and the consequences of the harm. The NDB scheme includes a non -exhaustive list of ‘relevant matters’ that may assist entities to assess the likelihood of serious harm. These are set out in s 26WG as follows: • the kind or kinds of information \\n                                                                    \\n22  See APP Guidelines, Chapter B: Key Concepts, section ‘Reasonable, reasonably’, OAIC website <https://www.oaic.gov.au>. .  Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n34 oaic.gov.au • the sensitivity of the information • whether the information is protected by one or more security measures  • if the information is protected by one or more security measures –  the likelihood that any of those security measures could be overcome  • the persons, or the kinds of persons, who have obtained, or who could obtain, the information  • if a security technology or methodology:  \\no was used in relation to the information, and;  \\no was designed to make the information unintelligible or meaningless to persons who are not authorised to obtain the information  • the likelihood that the persons, or the kinds of persons, who:  \\no have obtained, or who could obtain, the information, and;  \\no have, or are likely to have, the intention of causing harm to any of the individuals t o whom the information relates; \\no have obtained, or could obtain, information or knowledge required to circumvent the security technology or methodology • the nature of the harm • any other relevant matters. As some of these matters involve overlapping considerations , they are discussed further below, under the broader headings: 1. the type or types of personal information involved in the data breach  2. the circumstances of the data breach 3. the nature of the harm that may result from the data breach.  The type or types of personal information involved in the data breach  Some kinds of personal information may be more likely to cause an individual serious harm if compromised. Examples of the kinds of information that may increase the risk of serious harm if there is a data breach include: • ‘sensitive information’,\\n23 such as information about an individual’s health • documents commonly used for identity fraud (including  Medicare card, driver licence, and passport details) • financial information • a combination of types of personal information (rather than a single piece of personal information) that allows more to be known about the individuals the information is about.  \\n                                                                    \\n23  See s 6(1) of the Privacy Act for categories of personal information that are covered by the definition of ‘sensitive information’. Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n35 oaic.gov.au Circumstances of the data breach The specific circumstances of the data breach  are relevant when assessing whether there is a risk of serious harm to an individual. This may include consideration of the following:  • Whose personal information was involved in the breach? An entity could consider whose personal information was involved in the breach, as certain people may be at particular risk of serious harm. A data breach involving the names and addresses of individuals might not, in various circumstances, be likely to result in serious harm to an individual, particularly if that information is already publicly available. However, if the entity knows that the information involved primarily relates to individuals known to be vulnerable, this may increase the risk of serious harm \\n• How many individuals were involved? If the breach involves the personal information of \\nmany individuals, the scale of the breach should  affect an entity’s assessment of likely risks. Even if an entity considers that each individual will only have a small chance of suffering serious harm, if more people’s personal information is involved in the breach, it may be more likely that at least some of the individuals will experience serious harm . From a risk perspective, it may be prudent, depending on the particular circumstances , to assume a breach involving the personal information of a very large number of people is likely to result in serious harm to at least one of those individuals, unless context or circumstances would support this not being the case \\n• Do the circumstances of the data breach affect the sensitivity of the personal information? A breach that may publicly associate an individual’s personal information with a sensitive product or service they have used may increase the risk of serious harm . For example, a data breach involving an individual’s nam e may involve a risk of serious harm if the entity’s name links the individual with a particular form of physical or mental health care\\n24  • How long has the information been accessible? The time between when the data breach occurred and when the entity discovers the breach will be relevant to the entity’s consideration of whether serious harm is likely to occur. For example, if personal information is publically accessible for a significant period before the entity is aware of the data breach, it may be more likely that the personal information have been accessed  in ways that will result in serious harm to the individuals affected \\n• Is the personal information adequately encrypted, anonymised , or otherwise not easily \\naccessible? A relevant consideration is whether the information is rendered unreadable \\nthrough the use of security measures to protect the stored information, or if it is stored in such \\na way so that it cannot be used if breached.  In considering whether security measures (such as \\nencryption) applied to compromised data are adequate, the entity should consider whether \\nthe method of encryption is an industry-recognised secure standard at the time the entity is \\nassessing the likelihood of risk. Additionally, an entity should have regard to whether the unauthorised recipients of the personal information would have the capability  to circumvent these safeguards. For example, if an attacker holds both encrypted data and the encryption key needed to decrypt that data, the entity should not assume the data is secure  \\n• What parties have gained or may gain unauthorised access to the personal information? The unauthorised disclosure of an individual’s criminal record to someone who knows that \\n                                                                    \\n24  Another example would include the information disclosed in the Ashely Madison data breach in 2015 . See Ashley Madison Joint Investigation, OAIC website <https://www.oaic.gov.au>.   Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n36 oaic.gov.au individual personally may increase the risk of serious reputational harm for that individual. In addition, where a third party that obtains unauthorised access to personal information, or appears to target personal information of a particular individual or gro up of individuals, this may increase the risk of serious harm as it may be more likely the personal information is intended for malicious purposes. The nature of the harm  In assessing the risk of serious harm, entities should consider the broad range of p otential kinds of harms that may follow a data breach. It may be helpful for entities assessing the likelihood of harm to consider a number of scenarios that would result in serious harm and the likelihood of each. Examples may include: • identity theft • significant financial loss by the individual  • threats to an individual’s physical safety  • loss of business or employment opportunities  • humiliation, damage to reputation or relationships  • workplace or social bullying or marginalisation.  The likelihood of a particular harm occurring, as well as the anticipated consequences for individuals whose personal information is involved in the data breach if the harm materialises, are relevant considerations. \\nPreventing serious harm with remedial action \\nThe NDB scheme provides entities with the opportunity to take positive steps to address a data breach in a timely manner, and avoid the need to notify. If an entity takes remedial action such that the data breach would not be likely to result in  serious harm, then the breach is not an eligible data breach for that entity or for any other entity (s 26WF(1), s 26WF(2), s  26WF(3)). For breaches where information is lost, the remedial action is adequate if it prevents unauthorised access to, or disclosure of personal information (s 26WF(3)).  If the remedial action prevents the likelihood of serious harm  to some individuals within a larger group of individuals whose information was compromised in a data breach, notification to those  individuals for whom harm has been prevented is not required.  Examples of remedial action that may prevent serious harm occurring include:    Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n37 oaic.gov.au  \\n  \\nExample 1  A data file, which includes the personal information of numerous individuals, is sent to an incorrect recipient outside the entity. The sender realises the error and contacts the recipient, who advises that the data file has not been accessed. The recipient has an ongoing contractual relationship with the sender, and regards the recipient as reliable and trustworthy. The sender then confirms that the recipient has not copied, and has permanently deleted the data file. In the circumstances, the sender decides that there is no likely risk of serious harm.   \\n    \\n  \\nExample 2  An employee leaves a smartphone on public transport while on their way to work. When the employee arrives at work they realise that the smartphone has been lost, and ask their employer’s IT support staff to remotely delete the information on the smartphone. Because of the security measures on the smartphone, the IT support staff are confident that its content could not have been accessed in the short period between when it was lost and when its contents were deleted.     \\n     \\n Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n38 oaic.gov.au Examples of data breaches \\nThe following examples are provided to illustrate some of the considerations that entities might take into account when assessing whether a data breach is likely to result in serious harm.  However, whether any data breach is notifiable depends on the particular circumstances of the breach. The acts and practices described in these examples may raise other issues under the Privacy Act, such as whether these organisations have taken reasonable steps to secure personal information, as required by APP 11.1. \\n  \\nExample 1 — strong encryption making notification unnecessary Insure, an insurance company, decides to update its customer relationship management and record keeping software. While running a test, the IT team installing the software discovers that some customer records were accessed by an unau thorised third party more than a year ago. The customer records involved are primarily encrypted payment card information.  Since Insure suspects fraudulent activity as the motive for the unauthorised access, it notifies the police and hires an external IT security consultant to conduct an audit and security assessment. The audit confirms that 500 customer records were involved in the data breach, and that an overseas source was responsible for the hack. The IT security consultant’s comprehensive sweeps of t he internet and dark web were unable to find evidence that the information was offered for sale or otherwise disclosed online. The IT security consultant also assesses that because of the high standard of encryption used for the credit card information, it is unlikely that this information could be accessed by the hacker. Insure implemented the recommendations of its IT security consultant, including new IT security protocols and intrusion detection software.  Insure determines that it is not likely that the individuals whose personal information is involved in the data breach are at risk of serious harm. Therefore, Insure  decides it is not an eligible data breach, and is not required to notify affected individuals or the Commissioner.  Nonetheless, it decides that as a customer service measure, it should tell the individuals about the incident. It sends an email to the customers informing them of the incident and providing some advice on personal information security measures they can take. This notification is not required by the NDB scheme, so can take any form that Insure  considers appropriate.   \\n    \\n  \\nExample 2 — notification following unintentional publication of sensitive data  Medicines, a chain of low-cost pharmacies, becomes aware that its customer database, including records about dispensing of prescription drugs, has been publicly available on the internet due to a technical error. Medicines’  security consultants identify that the da tabase was publicly available for a limited time and that it was only accessed a few times.  Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n39 oaic.gov.au However, Medicines  is unable to determine who accessed the data or if they kept a copy. \\nGiven the sensitivity of the personal information contained in the database, including drugs related to the treatment of addictive and psychiatric conditions, Medicines’  risk assessment concludes that the data breach would be likely to result in serious harm to some of its customers. \\nMedicines decides to notify all customers whose personal information is involved in the data breach and the Commissioner. Because it does not have contact de tails for many of the customers who filled prescriptions with it in person, it publishes a notice describing the breach on its website and posts a copy in a prominent location at each of its stores.    \\n    \\n  \\nExample 3 — data breach experienced by overseas contractor leading to phishing  Consumestuff enters into a contract with an automated email marketing platform located overseas, which it uses to communicate with its customers. The service provider detects that the bulk mailing distribution lists for Consumestuff have been downloaded by an external IP address. The bulk mailing distribution lists include the name, email address, gender, and suburb of Consumestuffs’ customers. The service provider notifies Consumestuff , who conducts an immediate investigation into how the mailing lists were accessed and downloaded. An IT security sweep detects malware on a Consumestuff  employee’s computer, and the investigation concludes that the employee’s login credentials for the service provider were obtained after the employee unintentionally opened an email attachment from a malicious third party attacker. As Consumestuff also held the personal information, and assuming that the service provider is not an APP entity, Consumestuff  undertakes an assessment to determine whether it is required to notify individuals and the Commissioner.  As part of its assessment, Consumestuff identifies that some of the individuals whose personal information was involved in the data breach received emails that fraudulently claimed to be sent from Consumestuff asking for customer credit card details. Given this information, Consumestuff concludes that it is more probable than not that the attacker will use the information in the mailing lists for the purposes of fraud or identity theft,  and that it is likely that some of the individuals will suffer serious financial harm as a result of this.  Given this likelihood, Consumestuff sends an email with the relevant information required by the NDB scheme to those individuals whose personal inf ormation is involved in the data breach, and notifies the Commissioner. Consumestuffs’  email to these individuals includes information about scam emails and how to identify them, and provides referrals to services that assist individuals in mitigating the risk of identity theft.   \\n     Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n40 oaic.gov.au   \\nExample 4 — loss of unencrypted storage media containing personal information  A member of the human resources team of a Government Department (the Department) copies the employee records of the Department’s 2000 employees onto a portable memory stick, to do work at home. This action was in breach of the Department’s policies, and Australian Privacy Principle 11. The memory stick is lost by the employee who held it. They report this to their manager. The Department follows its data breach response plan, and as a first step conducts a search for the memory stick, but fails to locate it. The information contained in the memory stick includes the names, salary information, TFNs, home addresses, phone numbers, birth dat es, and in some cases health information (including disability information) of current staff. As the data on the memory stick is not encrypted, the Department concludes that unauthorised access is likely to occur. Due to the sensitivity of the unencrypted information – not only the extent and variety of the information, but also the inclusion of health and disability information in the records – the Department’s risk assessment finds that there is a likely risk of serious harm to at least one of the individuals whose personal information is involved in the data breach. On this basis, the Department considers that it is an eligible data breach for the purposes of the NDB scheme, and prepares a statement to notify the Commissioner.  A senior staff member emails the relevant staff to notify them of the eligible data breach, and provides the content of the statement prepared for the Commissioner. In the notification, the Department also offers staff an apology for the breach, notes that the OAIC has been informed of the breach, and explains what steps have been put in place to prevent this type of a breach occurring in the future.   \\n     Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n41 oaic.gov.au   \\nExample 5 — online banking fraud and remedial action  A bank’s fraud detection systems flag that there has been unusual activity on an individual’s online banking account, when a substantial amount of money is transferred to an account in another country. The fraud team assesses the activity, and finds that t he account was accessed by an unauthorised attacker who had obtained control of the individual’s account.  Through its existing fraud management processes, the bank’s fraud team notify the individual that it is temporarily freezing online access to the acc ount due to the fraudulent activity, resets the password for online access and returns the stolen funds. As part of its risk assessment, the fraud team confirms that the individual’s other accounts have not been compromised, and recommends to the individua l that they change any similar passwords to other services. A member of the bank’s fraud team assesses whether there is a risk of likely harm to the individual, and concludes that as a result of the above steps taken to remediate the unauthorised access, it is not likely the individual will be at risk of serious harm. Given this remedial action, the bank does not notify the Commissioner.    \\n   \\n  \\nExample 6 — email sent to the wrong recipient contained before serious harm can occur  CareHeeps, a claims management service provider, regularly sends updates to its clients about the status of the workers compensation claims of their employees. Because of human error, an employee of CareHeeps accidentally sends an email with an attachment about the  employees of Business A to another client, Business B. The attachment contains the personal information of 200 employees of Business A, and includes their name, address, date of birth, and health information about their claimed injury.  A CareHeeps employee realises the error, and contacts Business B to delete the email with the attachment. Business B confirms that one of its employees accessed the file without initially realising the error, but provides written confirmation that it has since deleted all copies of the email and attachment. The employee who accessed the file has also undertaken not to divulge the information. CareHeeps’ assessment of the remedial action taken concludes that, while the file included sensitive information about the individuals ’ health, its contractual arrangements with Business B and the written assurance provided by Business B has prevented the likely risk of serious harm to any individuals. As a consequence, CareHeeps determines that it is not an eligible data breach that needs to be notified to individuals or the Commissioner.   \\n  \\n  Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n42 oaic.gov.au Exceptions to notification obligations \\nKey points \\n• The NDB scheme requires regulated entities to notify individuals and the Commissioner of ‘eligible data breaches’. A data breach is an eligible data breach if an individual is likely to experience serious harm (see Identifying Eligible Data Breaches and Notifying Individuals About an Eligible Data Breach). • There are some exceptions to the notification requirements, which  relate to: \\no eligible data breaches of other entities (see Data Breaches Involving More Than One Entity) \\no enforcement related activities \\no inconsistency with secrecy provisions \\no declarations by the Commissioner. • Data breaches that are notified under s 75 of the My Health Records Act, do not need to be notified under the NDB scheme.   \\nEnforcement related activities \\nAn enforcement body does not need to notify individuals about an eligible data breach if its chief executive officer (CEO) believes on reasonable grounds that notifying individuals would be likely to prejudice an enforcement related activity  conducted by, or on behalf, of the enforcement body  (s 26WN).\\n25  ‘Believes on reasonable grounds’ means the CEO must have a basis for the belief. It is the responsibility of the enforcement body to be able to justify the reasonable grounds for this belief , and the decision should be documented . ‘Reasonable belief’ is discussed further in Chapter B of the OAIC’s APP Guidelines.\\n26 The enforcement body must still provide a statement about the eligible data breach to the Commissioner (see What to Include in an Eligible Data Breach Statement). However, this statement does not have to include the steps recommended for individuals to take in response to the data breach, because individuals are not being notified (s 26WN).  If this exception applies, and the eligible data breach involves other entities, these other entities are not required to notify individuals (s 26WN(e)). Further, these other entities are not required to provide a statement about the eligible data breach to the Commissioner if the enforcement body has done so (s 26WM). To rely on this exception, other entities would usually need a written statement regarding the eligible data breach, dated and signed by the  CEO of the enforcement body. This exception does not apply if an eligible data breach is unrelated to an enforcement activity . For example, the exception may not apply to an eligible data breach involving employees’ personal information, which is unrelated to an investigation. \\n                                                                    \\n25  See s 6(1) of the Privacy Act for definitions of enforcement body and enforcement related activity.  \\n26  Paragraphs B.110-B.111.  Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n43 oaic.gov.au Inconsistency with secrecy provisions \\nExceptions to notifying individuals or the Commissioner may apply where a Commonwealth law prohibits or regulates the use or disclosure of information (a secrecy provision). In particular: • the requirement to provide a statement to the Commissioner about the eligible data breach does not apply to the extent that this requirement is inconsistent with a secrecy provision (s 26WP(2)) • the requirement to notify individuals about an eligible data breach does not apply to the extent that providing this notice is inconsistent with a secrecy provision (s 26WP(3)).  The exceptions in s 26WP are intended to preserve the operation of specific secrecy provisions in other legislation. A common purpose of secrecy provisions is to prohibit the unauthorised disclosure of client information. Most secrecy provisions allow the disclosure of information in certain circumstances, such as with an individual’s consent where the information relates to them,  or where the disclosure of information relates to an officer’s duties, or the exercise of their powers or functions.  If an eligible data breach occurs, agencies should apply the exceptions under s 26WP only to the extent necessary to avoid inconsistency with a secrecy provision.  For example, if providing a statement about an eligible data breach to the Commissioner (s 26WK) would not be inconsistent with a secrecy provision, but notifying individuals (s 26WL) would be, the entity would only be required to notify the Commissioner.  The following is relevant in assessing whether a secrecy provision is inconsistent with the requirements of the NDB scheme: • If a secrecy provision permits the disclosure of information that is required or authorised by another law (such as the Privacy Act), there would not be an inconsistency between the secrecy provision and the NDB scheme notification requirements.  • If a secrecy provision does not allow the disclosure of information, even if the disclosure is required or authorised by another law (such as the Privacy Act), there may be inconsistency between the secrecy provision and the NDB scheme notification requirements.  • If a secrecy provision permits the disclosure of information in the course of an officer’s duties, there would not be inconsistency between the secrecy provision and the NDB scheme notification requirements, as complying with the notification requirements is the responsibility of the agency through its officers.  \\nDeclarations by the Australian Information Commissioner \\nIn some circumstances, the Commissioner may declare by written notice that an entity does not need to comply with the NDB scheme notification requirements (s 26WQ) in relation to a specific eligible data breach. The purpose of the declaration by the Commissioner is to provide an exception where compliance with the NDB notification requirements would conflict with the public interest. The Commissioner may declare that an entity is not required to provide a statement to the Commissioner or to notify particular individuals (s 26WQ(1)(c)), or that notification to individuals is delayed for a specified period (s 26WQ(1)(d)).  Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n44 oaic.gov.au The Commissioner cannot make a declaration under s 26WQ unless satisfied that it is reasonable in the circumstances to do so, having regard to the public interest, relevant advice received from an enforcement body or the Australian Signals Directorate, and any other relevant matter. While the Commissioner is empowered to make a declaration if it is ‘reasonable in the circumstance s to do so’, the Commissioner still has discretion about whether to make a declaration, and on what terms. In deciding whether to make a declaration, and on what terms, the Commissioner will have regard to the Objects of the Privacy Act and other relevant matters. The Commissioner will consider whether the risks associated with notifying of a particular eligible data breach outweigh the benefits of notification to individuals at risk of serious harm.  Given the clear objective of the scheme to promote notif ication of eligible data breaches, and the inclusion of exceptions in the scheme that remove the need to notify in a wide range of circumstances, the Commissioner expects that declarations under s 26WQ will only be made in exceptional cases and only after a compelling case has been put forward by the entity seeking the declaration. The procedure for applying for a declaration, and factors the Commissioner may consider, are outlined in the OAIC’s Guide to Privacy Regulatory Action —  Chapter 9: Data Breach Incidents. \\nMy Health Record system data breaches \\nCertain participants in the My Health Record system (such as the System Operator, a registered healthcare provider organisation, a registered repository operator, a registered portal operator or a registered contracted service provider), are required to report data breaches that occur in relation to the My Health Record system to the either the System Operator or the Commissioner, or both, depending on the entity reporting the data breach (s 75 of the My Health Records Act). If a data breach has been, or is required to be, notified under s 75 of the My Health Records Act , the NDB scheme does not apply (s 26WD). This exception is intended to avoid duplication of notices under the NDB scheme and the data breach notification requirements in the My Health Record system.   Information about data breach notification requirements of the My Health Records Act  is available in the OAIC’s Guide to Mandatory Data Breach Notification in the My Health Record System.\\n27 Only notifications under s 75 of the My Health Records Act fall within this exception. Notifications under other schemes such as that within the National C ancer Screening Register Act are not excluded from the NDB scheme.    \\n                                                                    \\n27  See Guide to Mandatory Data Breach Notification in the My Health Record System, OAIC website <https://www.oaic.gov.au>. Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n45 oaic.gov.au   \\nExample A practice manager who has access to the My Health Record system for administrative purposes only, accesses a patient’s My Health Record clinical information without authorisation. The GP discovers this incident and immediately notifies the System Operator and the Commissioner as required under s 75 of the My Health Records Act. There is no need to also notify this data breach under the Privacy Act. At or about the same time, the practice manager also accesses the GP’s clinical database (not part of the My Health Record system), and downloads their ex-partner’s health information without authorisation. Upon discovering this incident, the GP takes immediate steps to contain the breach and, due to the nature of the relationship between the practice manager and the patient, decides there is a likelihood of serious harm to the patient in the circumstances. The GP notifies the patient and the Commissioner about the data breach, as required under the Privacy Act’s NDB scheme.      \\n    \\n Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n46 oaic.gov.au Assessing a suspected data breach \\nKey points \\n• If an entity has reasonable grounds to believe that it has  experienced an eligible data breach, it must promptly notify individuals and the Commissioner about the breach, unless an exception applies. • In contrast, if an entity suspects that it may  have experienced an eligible data breach, it must quickly assess the situation to decide whether or not there has been an eligible data breach.  • An assessment must be reasonable and expeditious, and entities may develop their own procedures for assessing a suspected data breach. \\nWhen must entities assess a suspected breach? \\nThe NDB scheme is designed so that only serious (‘eligible’) data breaches are notified (see Identifying Eligible Data Breaches). If an entity is aware of reasonable grounds to believe that there has been an eligible data breach, it must promptly notify individuals at risk of seri ous harm and the Commissioner about the eligible data breach (see Notifying Individuals About an Eligible Data Breach). On the other hand, if an entity only has reason to suspect that there may have been a serious breach, it needs to move quickly to resolve that suspicion by assessing whether an eligible data breach has occurred. If, during the course of an assessm ent, it becomes clear that there has been an eligible breach, then the entity needs to promptly comply with the notification requirements.  The requirement for an assessment is triggered if an entity is aware that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that there may have been a serious breach (s 26WH(1)).  \\nWhether an entity is ‘aware’ of a suspected breach is a factual matter in each case, having regard to how a reasonable person who is properly informed would be expected to act in the circumstances. For instance, if a person responsible for compliance or personnel with appropriate seniority are aware of information that suggests a suspected breach may have occurred, an assessment should \\nbe done. An entity should not unreasonably delay an assessment of a sus pected eligible breach, for \\ninstance by waiting until its CEO or board is aware of information that would otherwise trigger \\nreasonable suspicion of a breach within the entity.   \\nThe Commissioner expects entities to have practices, procedures, and systems in place to comply with their information security obligations under APP 11, enabling suspected breaches to be promptly identified, reported to relevant personnel, and assessed if  necessary.  \\nHow quickly must an assessment be done? \\nAn entity must take all reasonable steps to complete the assessment within 30 calendar days after the day the entity became aware of the grounds (or information) that caused it to suspect an eligible data breach (s 26WH(2)).   The Commissioner expects that wherever possible entities treat 30 days as a maximum time limit for completing an assessment, and endeavour to complete the assessment in a much shorter timeframe, as the risk of serious harm to individuals often increases with time.   Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n47 oaic.gov.au Where an entity cannot reasonably complete an assessment within 30 days, the Commissioner recommends that it should document this, so that it is able demonstrate:  • that all reasonable steps have been taken to complete the assessment within 30 days  • the reasons for the delay • that the assessment was reasonable and expeditious.  \\nHow is an assessment done? \\nEntities must carry out a ‘reasonable and expeditious’ assessment (s 26WH(2)(a)). The Privacy Act does not set out how entities should assess a data breach, and entities may develop their own procedures for assessing a suspected breach.  The Commissioner expects that the amount of time and effort entities will expend in an assessment should be proportionate to the likelihood of t he breach and its apparent severity.  \\nThe Commissioner expects that an entity’s approach to data breach management, including its \\ndata breach response plan, will incorporate the requirements of the NDB scheme for asses sing suspected eligible data breaches.   While the Privacy Act does not specify how an assessment should occur, the OAIC suggests that an assessment could be a three-stage process: 1. Initiate: decide whether an assessment is necessary and identify which pers on or group will be responsible for completing it 2. Investigate: quickly gather relevant information about the suspected breach including, for example, what personal information is affected, who may have had access to the information and the likely impacts 3. Evaluate: make a decision, based on the investigation, about whether the identified breach is an eligible data breach (see Identifying Eligible Data Breaches). The Commissioner recommends that entities document the assessment process and outcome.  \\nRemedial action \\nAt any time, including during an assessment, an entity can, and should, take steps to reduce any potential harm to individuals caused by a suspected or eligible data breach. If remedial action is successful in preventing serious harm to affected individuals, notification is not required (as explained in Identifying Eligible Data Breaches). \\nBreach established — what next? \\nOnce an entity is aware that there are reasonable grounds to believe that there has been an eligible data breach – whether during the course of an assessment, or when the assessment is complete –  it must promptly notify affected individuals and the Commiss ioner about the breach (see What to Include in an Eligible Data Breach Statement and Notifying Individuals About an Eligible Data Breach).  \\n Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n48 oaic.gov.au Notifying individuals about an eligible data breach \\nKey points \\n• When an entity experiences a data breach, its first step should be to contain the breach where possible and take remedial action. Where serious harm cannot be mitigated through r emedial action (see Identifying Eligible Data Breaches), it must notify individuals at risk of serious harm and provide a statement to the Commissioner as soon as practicable.  • If it is not practicable to notify individuals at risk of serious harm , an entity must publish a copy of the statement prepared for the Commissioner on its website, and  take reasonable steps to bring its contents to the attention of individuals at risk of serious harm.  • If a single eligible data breach applies to multiple ent ities, only one entity needs to notify the Commissioner and individuals at risk of serious harm. It is up to the entities to decide who notifies. Generally, the Commissioner suggests that the entity with the most direct relationship with the individuals at risk of serious harm should undertake the notification.  \\nWho needs to be notified? \\nOnce an entity has reasonable grounds to believe there has been an eligible data breach, the entity must, as soon as practicable, make a decision about which individuals to notify, prepare a statement for the Commissioner and notify individuals of the contents of this statement.  The NDB scheme provides flexibility — there are three options for notifying individuals at risk of serious harm, depending on what is ‘practicable’ for the entity (s 26WL(2)).   Whether a particular option is practicable involves a consideration of the time, effort, and cost of notifying individuals at risk of serious harm in a particular manner. These factors should be considered in light of the capabilities and capacity of the entity. Option 1 — Notify all individuals  If it is practicable, an entity can notify each of the individuals to whom the relevant information relates (s 26WL(2)(a)). That is, all individuals whose personal information was part of the eligible data breach.  This option may be appropriate, and the simplest method, if an entity cannot reasonably assess which particular individuals are at risk of serious harm from an eligible data breach that involves personal information about many people, but where the entity has formed the view that serious harm is likely for one or more of the individuals.   The benefits of this approach include ensuring  that all individuals who may be at risk of serious harm are notified, and allowing them to consider whether they need to take any action in response to the eligible data breach.  Option 2 — Notify only those individuals at risk of serious harm  If it is practicable, an entity can notify only those individuals who are at risk of serious harm from the eligible data breach (s 26WL(2)(b)). That is, individuals who are likely to experience serious harm as a result of the eligible data breach . If an entity identifies that only a particular individual, or a specific subset of individuals, involved in Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n49 oaic.gov.au an eligible data breach is at risk of serious harm, and can specifically identify those individuals, only those individuals need to be notified.  The benefits of this targeted approach include avoiding unnecessary distress to individuals who are not at risk, limiting possible notification fatigue among members of the public, and reducing administrative costs, where it is not required by the NDB scheme.   \\n  \\nExample  \\nAn attacker installs malicious software on a retailer’s website. The software allows the attacker to intercept payment card details when customers make purchases on the website. The attacker is also able to access basic account details for all customers who have an account on the website. Following a comprehensive risk assessment, the retailer considers that the individuals who made purchases during the period that the malicious software was active are at likely risk of serious harm, due to the likelihood of payment card fraud. Based on this assessment, the retailer also considers that those customers who only had basic account details accessed are not at likely risk of serious harm. The retailer is only required to \\nnotify those individuals t hat it considers to be at likely risk of serious harm.    \\n  \\nOption 3 — Publish notification If neither option 1 or 2 above are practicable, for example, if the entity does not have up -to-date contact details for individuals, then the entity must:  • publish a copy of the statement on its website if it has one  • take reasonable steps to publicise the contents of the statement (s 26WL(2)(c)).  It is not enough to simply upload a copy of the statement prepared for the Commissioner on any webpage of the entity’s website. Entities must also take proactive steps to publicise the substance of the eligible data breach (and at least the contents of the statement), to increase the likelihood that the eligible data breach will come to the attention of individuals at risk of  serious harm.  While the Privacy Act does not specify the amount of time that an entity must keep the statement accessible on their website, the Commissioner would generally expect that it is available for at least 6 months. \\n  \\nExample  \\nIn the process of cleaning up his old desktop, an accountant accidently sends a spreadsheet containing the TFN and contact information of his past clients to his entire email contact list. He is worried that the information contained could be used for identity th eft and understands that ‘recalling’ emails does not usually work. He emails his contact list to request that they immediately delete the spreadsheet and notify him when this has happened. In addition, since the file is over ten years old, he decides that notifying individuals directly (through option 1 or 2) would not be practicable, as their contact details would more than likely be outdated. He notifies the Commissioner about the data breach \\nand publicises a notification (option 3).    \\n   Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n50 oaic.gov.au How do I notify and what do I need to say? \\nOptions 1 (Notify all individuals) and 2 (Notify only those individuals at risk of serious harm)  Options 1 and 2 above require that entities take ‘such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances  to notify individuals about the contents of the statement ’ that the entity prepared for the Commissioner (s 26WL(2)(a) and (b)).  The entity can use any method to notify individuals (for example, a telephone  call, SMS, physical mail, social media post, or in-person conversation), so long as the method is reasonable. In considering whether a particular method, or combination of methods is reasonable, the notifying entity should consider the likelihood that the people it is notifying will become aware of, an d understand the notification, and weigh this against the resources involved in undertaking notification. An entity can notify an individual using their usual method of communicating with that particular individual (s 26WL(4)). For example, if an entity usually communicates through a nominated intermediary, they may also choose to notify through this intermediary.  The entity can tailor the form of its notification to individuals, as long as it includes the content of the statement required by s 26WK. That statement (and consequently, the notification to individuals) must include the following information:  1. the identity and contact details of the entity ( s 26WK(3)(a)) 2. a description of the eligible data breach that the entity has reasonable grounds to  believe has happened (s 26WK(3)(b)) 3. the kind, or kinds, of information concerned (s 26WK(3)(c)) 4. recommendations about the steps that individuals should take in response to the eligible data breach (s 26WK(3)(d)).  Decisions about the appropriate types of recommendations will always be dependent on the circumstances of the eligible data breach. This may include  choosing to tailor recommended steps around an individual’s personal circumstances, or providing general recommendations that apply to all individuals. In some circumstances, the entity may have already taken some protective steps, reducing the necessity for action by affected individuals. The entity may choose to explain these measures in the notice to individuals as a part of their recommendation. F or example, a bank may notify an individual that it has suspended suspicious transactions on their account and recommended steps may be limited to suggesting the individual monitor their accounts and notify the bank immediately of any other suspicious tran sactions.   Option 3 (Publish notification) Option 3, which can only be used if options 1 or 2 are not practicable, requires an entity to publish a copy of the statement prepared for the Commissioner  on its website, and take reasonable steps to publicise the contents of that statement.  An entity should consider what steps are reasonable in the circumstances of the entity and the data breach to publicise the statement. The purpose of publicising the statement is to draw it to the attention of individuals at risk of serious harm, so the entity should consider what mechanisms would be most likely to bring the statement to the attention of those people.  Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n51 oaic.gov.au A reasonable step when publicising an online notice, might include: • ensuring that the notice is prominently placed on the relevant webpage, which can be easily located by individuals and indexed by search engines • publishing an announcement on the entity’s social media channels  • taking out a print or online advertisement in a publication or on a website the entity considers reasonably likely to reach individuals at risk of serious harm. In some cases, it might be reasonable to take more than one step to publicise the contents of the statement. For example, if a data breach involves a particularly serious form of har m, or affects a large number of individuals, an entity could take out multiple print or online advertisements (which could include paid advertisements on social media channels), publish posts on multiple social media channels, or use both traditional media  and online channels. The approach to publicising the statement may depend on the publication method. For example, where space and cost allows, an entity may republish the entirety of the information required to be included in the statement. Another option , if the available space is limited, or the cost of republishing the entire statement would not be reasonable in all the circumstances, would be to summarise the information required to be included in the statement and provide a hyperlink to the copy of the statement published on the entity’s website. Entities should keep in mind the ability and likelihood of individuals at risk of serious harm being able to access the statement when  determining the appropriateness of relying solely on such an approach.  If option 3 is chosen, entities should take care to ensure that the online notice does not contain any personal information. While it may help if entities provide a general description of the coh ort of affected individuals, this description should not identify any of the affected individuals or provide information that may make an individual reasonably identifiable. For example, it may be appropriate for an online retailer to publicise that individuals who made transactions in the year 2013 may be affected, but it would not be appropriate for the retailer to publicise the names associated with any compromised transaction data.  \\nTiming of notification \\nEntities must notify individuals as soon as pract icable after completing the statement prepared for notifying the Commissioner (s 26WL(3)). Considerations of cost, time, and effort may be relevant in an entity’s decision about when to notify individuals. However, the Commissioner generally expects entities to expeditiously notify individuals at risk of serious harm about an eligible data breach unless cost, time,  and effort are excessively prohibitive in all the circumstances.  If entities have notified individuals at risk of serious harm of the data breac h before they notify the Commissioner, they do not need to notify those individuals again, so long as the individuals were notified of the contents of the statement given to the Commissioner. The scheme does not require that notification be given to the Commissioner before individuals at risk of serious harm, so if entities wish to begin notifying those individuals before, or at the same time as notifying the Commissioner, they may do so.  \\n Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n52 oaic.gov.au What to include in an eligible data breach statement \\nKey points \\n• The NDB scheme requires entities to notify individuals about an eligible data breach (see Identifying Eligible Data Breaches). • Entities are also required to prepare a statement and provide a copy to the Commissioner (s 26WK). The OAIC’s online form may help entities to do this.  • The statement must include the name and contact details of the entity, a description of the eligible data breach, the kind or kinds of information involved, and what steps the entity recommends that individuals at risk of serious harm take in response to the eligible data breach (s 26WK(3)) • Entities must notify affected individuals about the contents of this statement or, if this i s not practicable, publish a copy of the statement on the entity’s website and take reasonable steps to publicise the contents of the statement (s  26WL(2)) (see Notifying individuals about an eligible data breach). \\nWhat must be included in the statement \\nA statement about an eligible data breach must include:  • the identity and contact details of the entity (s 26WK(3 )(a)) • a description of the eligible data breach (s 26WK(3)(b)) • the kind or kinds of information involved in the eligible data breach (s 26WK(3)(c))  • what steps the entity recommends that individuals take in response to the eligible data breach (s 26WK(3)(d)). Identity and contact details of the entity  Where an entity’s company name is different to the business or trading name, the OAIC recommends that entities also include the name that is most familiar to individuals. The entity must also include information about how an individual can contact it. Depe nding on the nature and scale of the breach, the entity may wish to consider whether to provide its general contact details, or establish a dedicated phone line or email address to answer queries from individuals.  Description of the eligible data breach An entity is required to include ‘a description’ of the data breach in its statement.  The OAIC expects that the statement will include sufficient information about the data breach to allow affected individuals the opportunity to properly assess the possibl e consequences of the data breach for them, and to take protective action in response.  Information describing the eligible data breach may include:  • the date, or date range, of the unauthorised access or disclosure  • the date the entity detected the data bre ach Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n53 oaic.gov.au • the circumstances of the data breach (such as any known causes for the unauthorised access or disclosure) • who has obtained or is likely to have obtained access to the information  • relevant information about the steps the entity has taken to contain or r emediate the breach.  In general, the OAIC does not expect entities to identify the specific individuals who have accessed information, unless this is relevant to the steps the entity recommends individuals might take in response. For example, where information has been accidentally disclosed in a family violence situation known to the entity, this would be important information for the individual to know.  Usually, however, it would suffice to provide a general description of the type of person who has obtained the information, such as ‘an external third party’ or ‘former employee’.  The kind or kinds of information concerned  The statement must include the kind or kinds of information involved in the data breach. Knowing what kind of personal information has been breached is critical to assessing what action should be taken by individuals following a data breach.  Entities, in assessing the data breach, should clearly establish what information was involved in the data breach, including whether the breach i nvolved ‘sensitive information’\\n28 (such as information about an individual’s health), government related identifiers (such as a Medicare number or driver licence number), or financial information.  Steps recommended to individuals in response to the eligible data breach The statement must include recommendations individuals should take in response to the data breach, to mitigate the serious harm or likelihood of serious harm from the data breach.  The nature of recommendations will depend on the entity’s func tions and activities, the circumstances of the eligible data breach, and the kind or kinds of information that were involved. Recommendations should include practical steps that are easy for the individuals to action.  For example, to help reduce the risk of identity theft or fraud, recommendations in response to a data breach that involved individuals’ Medicare numbers might include steps an individual can take to request a new Medicare card. Or in the case of a data breach that involved credit card information, putting individuals at risk of identity theft, recommendations might include that an individual contact their financial institution to change their credit card number, and also contact a credit reporting body to establish a ban period on their credit report.  Where the entity does not have the requisite knowledge or capacity to provide advice to affected individuals, they should seek specialist advice or assistance in preparing this section. In limited circumstances, after seeking advice, the entity m ay use this section to advise individuals that no steps are required.  \\n                                                                    \\n28  See s 6(1) of the Privacy Act for categories of personal information that are covered by the definition of ‘sensitive information’. Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n54 oaic.gov.au Additional information to provide \\nOther entities involved in the data breach  If more than one entity holds personal information that was compromised in an eligible data breach, only one entity needs to prepare a statement and notify individuals about the data breach (s 26WM, and see Data Breaches Involving More Than One Entity). This may occur when an entity outsources the handling of personal information, is involved in a joint venture, or where it has a shared services arrangement with another entity.  When a data breach affects more than one entity, the entity that prepares the statement may include the identity and contact details of the other entities involved (s 26WK(4)). Whether an entity includes the identity and contact details of other involved entities in its statement will depend on the circumstances of the eligible data breach, and the relationship between the entities and the individuals involved. The Privacy Act does not require this information to be included on the statement, and it is open to entities to assess whether it is us eful to provide this information to individuals.  The OAIC recognises that in some instances the identity and contact details of a third party may not be relevant to an individual whose personal information is involved in an eligible data breach, for example, where the individual does not have a relationship with the other entity. In these circumstances, rather than include the identity and contact details of the third party or parties, the entity that prepares the statement may wish to describe the nature of the relationship with the third party in its description of the data breach.  \\nWhen to provide a copy of the statement to the Commissioner  \\nEntities must prepare and give a copy of the statement to the Commissioner as soon as practicable after becoming aware of the eligible data breach (s 26WK(2)). What is a ‘practicable’ timeframe will vary depending on the entity’s circumstances, and may include considerations of the time, effort, or cost required to prepare the statement.  The OAIC expects that once an entity becomes aware of an eligible data breach, it will provide a statement to the Commissioner promptly, unless there are circumstances that reasonably hinder the entity’s ability to do so. It may be appropriate in some circumstances for an entity to advise individuals about the contents of the statement before or at the same time that it gives the statement to the Commissioner, rather than waiting. While a statement provided to the Commissioner and individuals must include certain information outlined above (s 26WK(3)), where additional relevant information becomes available after submitting this statement, the entity may provide this to the OAIC. The OAIC will include instructions about how to provide any supplementary information upon receipt of the statement.  \\nHow to provide the statement to the Commissioner \\nThe OAIC has an online form for entities to lodge all eligible date breach statements under section 26WK of the Privacy Act. If you are unable to use the online form, please contact the OAIC enquiries line to make alternative arrangements.  \\n Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n55 oaic.gov.au Australian Information Commissioner’s role in the NDB scheme  \\nKey points \\nThe Commissioner has a number of roles under the NDB scheme in the Privacy Act. These include:  • receiving notifications of eligible data breaches • encouraging compliance with the scheme, including by handling complaints, conducting investigations, and taking other regulatory action in response to instances of non -compliance • offering advice and guidance to regulated entities, and providing information to the community about the operation of the scheme.  This document summarises how the Commissioner anticipates exercising these functions. For more information about the Commissioner’s regulatory powers and how those powers are exercised, see the OAIC’s Privacy Regulatory Action Policy\\n29 and the Guide to Privacy Regulatory Action.\\n30 \\nNotifications of data breaches to the Commissioner \\nHow to notify the Commissioner Once an entity has reasonable grounds to believe there has been an eligible data breach and it is not exempted from notifying, it is required to provide notification to individuals at risk of serious harm and the Commissioner. When notifying the Commissioner, the entity must provide a notification statement that contains the following information (s 26WK(3)):  1. The identity and contact details of the notifying entity.  2. A description of the data breach. 3. The kind or kinds of information concerned.  4. Recommendations to individuals about the ste ps that they should take to minimise the impact of the breach. An online form is available on the OAIC website to help entities lodge notification statements and provide additional supporting information (see What to I nclude in an Eligible Data Breach Statement). Providing voluntary information Although not required by the Privacy Act, entities may provide additional supporting information  to the Commissioner to explain the circumstances of the data  breach and the entity’s response in further detail. For example, entities may choose to provide the Commissioner with technical \\n                                                                    \\n29  The Privacy Regulatory Action Policy explains the OAIC’s approach to using its privacy regulatory powers and \\ncommunicating information publicly.

This information will assist the Commissioner to decide whether to make further inquiries or to take any other action. It may also be used by the Commissioner when preparing statistical reports about notifications received. When a data breach affects more than one entity, the entity that prepares  the statement may also choose to include the identity and contact details of the other entities involved (s 26WK(4)). The Privacy Act does not require this information to be included on the statement, and it is open to entities to assess whether it is useful to provide this information in the statement.  Confidentiality of information provided in notifications  If an entity elects to provide additional supporting information to the Commissioner, it may request that the Commissioner hold that information in c onfidence. The Commissioner will respect the confidence of commercially or operationally sensitive information provided voluntarily in support of a data breach notification, and will only disclose such information after consulting with the notifying entity, and with the entity’s agreement or where required by law.  If the Commissioner receives a freedom of information (FOI) request for a notification statement or additional supporting information, the Commissioner will consult with the entity that made the notification before responding. As a matter of course, the Commissioner will offer to transfer any FOI requests relating to agencies to the agencies in question.  The Commissioner’s response to notifications  The Commissioner will acknowledge receipt of all data breach notifications.  The Commissioner may also make inquiries or offer advice and guidance in response to notifications. In deciding whether to make inquiries or offer advice and guidance in response to a notification, the Commissioner may consider t he type and sensitivity of the personal information, the numbers of individuals potentially at risk of serious harm, and the extent to which the notification statement and any additional supporting information provided demonstrate that:  • the data breach has been contained or is in the process of being contained where feasible  • the notifying entity has taken, or is taking, reasonable steps to mitigate the impact of the breach on the individuals at risk of serious harm  • the entity has taken, or is taking, reasonable steps to minimise the likelihood of a similar breach occurring again. The Commissioner may also decide to take regulatory action on the Commissioner’s own initiative in response to a notification, or a series of notifications. In deciding whether to take regulatory action, the Commissioner will have regard to the OAIC’s Priv acy regulatory action policy and Guide to privacy regulatory action. However, generally the Commissioner’s priority when responding to notifications is to provide guidance to the entity and to assist individuals at risk of serious harm.  \\nThe Commissioner’s enforcement of the NDB scheme \\nThe Commissioner has a number of enforcement powers to ensure that entities meet their obligations under the scheme. A failure by an entity to meet any of the following requirements of the scheme is an interference with the pr ivacy of an individual (s 13(4A)):  Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n57 oaic.gov.au • Conduct a reasonable and expeditious assessment of a suspected eligible data breach (s 26WH(2)), taking all reasonable steps to ensure that this assessment is completed within 30 days of becoming aware (s 26WH(2)(b)). • Prepare a statement about the data breach, and give a copy to the Commissioner, as soon as practicable (s 26WK(2)). • Notify the contents of the statement to individuals at risk of serious harm (or, in certain circumstances, publish the statement) as soon as p racticable (s 26WL(3)). • Comply with a direction from the Commissioner to prepare a statement and notify as soon as practicable (s 26WR(10)). The enforcement powers available to the Commissioner in response to an interference with privacy, which range from less serious to more serious regulatory action , include powers to: • accept an enforceable undertaking (s 33E) and bring proceedings to enforce an enforceable undertaking (s 33F) • make a determination (s 52) and bring proceedings to enforce a determination (s s 55A and 62) • seek an injunction to prevent ongoing activity or a recurrence (s 98)  • apply to court for a civil penalty order for a breach of a civil penalty provision (s 80W), which includes a serious or repeated interference with privacy (s 13G).\\n 31 The Commissioner is also required, in most circumstances, to investigate a complaint made by an individual about an interference with the individual’s privacy (s 36), which would include a failure to notify an individual at risk of serious harm of an eligible da ta breach where required to do so. In deciding when to exercise enforcement powers in relation to a contravention of the NDB  scheme, the Commissioner will have regard to the OAIC’s Privacy Regulatory Action Policy  and the circumstances outlined in Chapter 9: Data Breach Incidents of the OAIC’s Guide to Privacy Regulatory Action. The preferred approach of the Commissioner is to work with entities to encourage and facilitate compliance with an entity’s obligations under the Privacy Act before taking enforcement action. The Commissioner acknowledges that it will take time for all regulated entities to become familiar with the requirements of the NDB scheme. During the first 12 months of the scheme’s operation, the Commissioner’s primary focus will be on working with entities to ensure that they understand the new requirements and are working in good faith to implement them .  \\nThe Commissioner’s other powers and functions under the scheme  \\nDirection to notify (s 26WR) The Commissioner can direct an entity to notify individuals at risk of serious harm, as well as the Commissioner, about an eligible data breach in certain circumstances. Before directing an entity to notify, the Commissioner will usually ask the entity to agree to notify. This might happen if a data breach comes to the attention of the Commissioner but ha s not come \\n                                                                    \\n31  For more information about civil penalty provisions in the Privacy Act, see Guide to Privacy Regulatory Action , Chapter 6: Civil Penalties — Serious or Repeated Interference With Privacy and Other Penalty Provisions .  Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n58 oaic.gov.au to the attention of the relevant entity, or if the Commissioner does not agree with the entity’s initial view about whether a data breach triggers an obligation to notify . If the Commissioner and the entity cannot agree about whether notification should occur, the Commissioner will give the entity an opportunity to make a formal submission about why notification is not required, or if notification is required, on what terms. The Commissioner will consider the submission and any other relevant information before deciding whether to direct the entity to notify under s 26WR. Declaration that notification need not be made, or that notification be delayed (s  26WQ) The Commissioner may declare that notification of a particular data breach is not required (s 26WQ(1)(c)). The Commissioner may also modify the period in which notification needs to occur (s 26WQ(1)(d)). The Commissioner cannot make a declaration under s 26WQ unless satisfied that it is reasonable in the circumstances to do so, having regard to the public interest, any relevant advice received from an enforcement body or the Australian Signals Directorate, and any other relevant matter. While the Commissioner is empowered to make a declaration if it is ‘reasonable in the circumstances to do so’, the Commissioner still has discretion about whether to make a declaration, and on what terms. In deciding whether to make a declaration, and on what terms, the Commissioner will have regard to the objects of the Privacy Act (s 2A) and other relevant matters. The Commissioner will consider whether the risks associated with notifying a particular data breach outweigh the benefits of notification to individuals at risk of serious harm. Given the clear objective of the scheme to promote notification of eligible data breaches to affected individuals, and the inclusion of exceptions in the scheme that remove the need to notify in a wide range of circumstances, the Commissioner expects that declaratio ns under s 26WQ will be limited to exceptional cases. An entity applying for a declaration will be expected to make a well -reasoned and convincing case detailing how the data breach is an eligible data breach, why any relevant exceptions do not apply, and why notification should not occur or should be delayed. The entity should provide detailed evidence or information in support of its application.  \\nAdvice, guidance, and community information \\nThe Commissioner provides general information to the co mmunity about the Privacy Act, including the NDB scheme, via the OAIC’s website or its public enquiries service. The Commissioner has developed this guide and other resources, which are available on the OAIC’s website, to help entities comply with the scheme.  However, the Commissioner will not be able to provide detailed advice about the application of the scheme to specific data breaches. Entities should seek their own legal and technical advice.  Part of the Commissioner’s role in the NDB scheme is to promote transparency in the way that entities handle personal information. To this end, the Commissioner will regularly publish de - identified statistical information about data breaches notified under the scheme.   \\n Data breach preparation and response  \\nJuly 2019 \\n59 oaic.gov.au Part 5: Other sources of information \\nThis guide has focussed on how to manage data breaches affecting personal information for entities with obligations under the Privacy Act.  Entities may need to consider whether the circumstances of a data breach trigge rs other requirements, or if the type of information that they hold warrants specific actions to prepare for and manage a data breach.  For instance, it may be appropriate to seek advice from the Australian Taxation Office for a data breach that involves t ax file numbers; or to seek guidance from the Australian Digital Health Agency if a data breach involves information stored in the My Health Record system.   Entities may also be required to notify other regulators about certain matters under industry - specific regulation; or to notify professional associations about matters related to a data breach. Contractual arrangements may also create obligations to do certain things to prepare for a data breach, and to share certain information in the event of a data breach. Relevant sources of advice in the event of a data breach (in addition to the Commissioner) may include: • federal or State or Territory police or law enforcement bodies  • the affected entity’s financial services provider  • Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) • Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA)  • Australian Taxation Office (ATO)  • Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC)\\n32 • CERT Australia • Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC)  • Australian Digital Health Agency (ADHA)\\n33 • Department of Health\\n34 • State or Territory Privacy and Information Commissioners\\n35 • IDcare, or other organisations that support individuals affected by data breaches  • professional associations and professional regulatory bodies • third parties under an agreement or contract, for example contracted service providers or insurance providers. \\n                                                                    \\n32  Further information about cyber security incidents that should be reported is available at <https://www.cyber.gov.au/report >.  \\n33  For data breaches involving the My Health Record system.  \\n34  For data breaches involving the National Cancer Screening Register.  \\n35  For more information about state and territory jurisdictions, see Privacy in Your State, OAIC website <https://www.oaic.gov.au>.

Leaps forward by open-access tools like ChatGPT have accelerated interest in AI technologies. Business leaders can better visualise the potential benefits AI could bring to their organisations, but many remain risk-averse and apprehensive about AI technologies.1 \\nDeciding on what AI to build, buy or borrow.  To be globally competitive, Australia needs to set conditions that support AI adoption as well as create unique AI capabilities. This could include addressing the persisting challenge of scaling Australia’s strong academic and research outputs into commercial innovations.3 \\nPrioritising being an AI specialist over an AI \\ngeneralist. Acknowledging our population, market and funding size can limit Australia’s capacity to compete in the global AI arena, there could be opportunities to \\ngrow world -le ading capabilities in strategic areas of AI \\nspecialisation. These\\xa0areas of AI specialisation should be based on domains where Australia has a strategic and/or comparative\\xa0advantage.4 \\nNeed more awareness of local AI service \\nproviders. Australian companies are opting for international AI service providers when the capabilities do not exist or cannot be identified locally.

There is a significant opportunity for Australia to be a global leader in the development and use of safe and responsible AI technologies. The ‘Australian brand’ is a trusted asset, which puts us in a strong position to drive future safe and responsible AI developments.5 \\nStrengthening linkages across the AI ecosystem.  Australia’s AI ecosystem requires strong leadership and improved connectivity across the sector. Doing so will maximise opportunities for Australia to define and strengthen its global reputation in AI and mature as an\\xa0ecosystem.7 \\nGrowing Australia’s AI talent and business \\necosystem. Talent shortages are a persisting struggle reported by Australian businesses, particularly when it comes to sourcing specialised technical skills. Australia could consider new approaches to inject talent into the AI ecosystem and reduce friction for professionals working in these areas.8 \\n5Introduction\\nWhat is this report about?\\nThis is the second report about Australia’s artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem with the first being published in 2022 (NAIC, 2022). It has been commissioned by the National Artificial Intelligence Centre (NAIC) and delivered by CSIRO. Australia’s AI ecosystem is comprised of startups, small-to-large-sized companies, universities, research institutes, industry organisations and public sector agencies engaged in developing and applying AI technologies. This\\xa0report aims to provide a snapshot of the current state of Australia’s AI ecosystem and inform future strategy and policy decisions about its growth and development.\\nWhy read this report?\\nThis report contains information about companies, product innovation, investment, universities, research institutes and specialised capabilities relating to AI in Australia. It also contains information about the perceived challenges and opportunities for future growth and development of AI in Australia. The report aims to inform people in industry, academia, government and community spheres making decisions about AI capability uplift.This report is useful to anyone wanting to understand and develop AI capability in Australia. It could be used by investors looking for opportunities in the Australian marketplace. It could be used by a company wanting to train and recruit AI talent. It could be used by someone starting or developing an AI company. It could be used by universities and research institutes planning for AI capability development. It could be used by Local, State/Territory and Federal government agencies aiming to support the AI industry and job growth. And it could be used by workers and students planning their AI careers.What is the Australian AI\\xa0ecosystem?\\nThe AI ecosystem comprises companies (startups, small, medium and large enterprises), universities, education and training institutes, research institutes, industry bodies and professional associations concerned with the development and application of AI in Australia. Whilst practically all organisations use AI to some extent, this report focuses on companies and research institutes that have a primary or substantial focus on AI. We identify several sub-sectors within the AI ecosystem:\\n1. Small, medium, large and startup companies that make\\xa0and sell AI products and services\\n2. Research institutes and universities significantly engaged in developing and applying AI\\n3. Venture capital and other investors who inject capital\\xa0into the AI industry\\n4. Industry associations, professional bodies and\\xa0community organisations\\n5. Education and training institutions1\\n6. Government bodies that support and regulate the\\xa0AI\\xa0industry\\n1\\n7. Workers in AI occupations1\\n1 These sub-sectors were out of scope for the current report as we currently \\ndo not have datasets or standardised reporting frameworks for capturing information on these sub-sectors. We hope that future versions of this report will be able to shed light on these other parts of the Australian AI ecosystem.1 These sub-sectors were out of scope for the current report as we currently do not have datasets or standardised reporting frameworks for capturing \\ninformation on these sub-sectors. We hope that future versions of this report will be able to shed light on these other parts of the Australian AI ecosystem.\\n6 Australia’s artificial intelligence ecosystemWhy is Australia’s AI ecosystem\\xa0significant?\\nAustralia, along with most advanced economies, is grappling with an ongoing productivity slump (Australian\\xa0Government, 2023). This causes lower rates of economic growth and a reduced growth rate in living standards. AI\\xa0is a general-purpose technology that could turn things around. AI is impacting every policy sphere, industry sector and (practically) every career. This impact will intensify in the future.When used well, AI allows people to do things faster, cheaper, safer and better. Just like electricity in the 1920s, AI\\xa0has the capability to deliver an economy-wide productivity boost in the 2020s and beyond. Many new jobs, startups and corporations will be created through AI over the coming years. Many existing companies and workers will be impacted, which is part of the reason why AI\\xa0is attracting so much attention. It is both a critical enabler of economic activity and a driver of disruption.\\nWhat’s changing in the world of AI?\\nThe year 2023 is considered by some as a new phase in the journey of AI. We’ve seen the rapid ascendancy of foundation AI models and generative AI such as ChatGPT, DALL-E 2 (OpenAI), GitHub Copilot, Imogen, Codey, Chirp (Google), Llama 2 (Meta AI) and others. Many more such models are likely to emerge over the coming months and years. Foundation models such as these are typically trained on vast quantities of data and can be used to perform a wide variety of tasks and solve problems across virtually all\\xa0industries.The global AI sector is racing to build new foundation models and plug-ins to existing models. This will be associated with the emergence and rapid scale-up of new AI companies. It will also change what’s possible for existing companies with the prospect of a significant productivity uplift. There is much uncertainty about how the next generation of foundation AI models will play out, but a significant impact on Australia’s economy and industry is certain. It’s already happening.Where does our information come\\xa0from?\\nTo describe the AI ecosystem, we draw upon large commercial databases which are often used by investors when searching for companies such as Crunchbase and PitchBook. These databases contain detailed industry classifications and wide-ranging company data. Our analysis of AI product innovation and research activity largely comes from The Lens, a comprehensive database on Australian and global scholarly publishing and patent applications. We also complemented these analyses with structured qualitative interviews with experts and\\xa0stakeholders across the Australian AI ecosystem.\\nWhat’s in this report?\\nThe report is broken up into three main sections. The first section presents information on the AI industry in Australia through the lens of startups and small, medium and large companies whose primary business model involves making and selling AI products and services. We\\xa0examine the temporal and spatial patterns of these AI companies and classify their AI offerings. The next section focuses on the research and development sector, examining patterns of AI research publishing and patent applications in Australia and areas of global specialisation. We also present information about the AI research activities of Australia’s leading universities and research institutes. The\\xa0final section presents insights from interviews with experts across Australia’s AI ecosystem, shedding light on the opportunities and barriers facing the ecosystem.\\n7 \\n1 \\nArtificial\\xa0intelligence companies\\nStartups and small, medium and large Australian‑headquartered companies whose primary\\xa0business activity is making and\\xa0selling\\xa0AI\\xa0products\\xa0and\\xa0services to customers.\\n8 Australia’s artificial intelligence ecosystemHow we identify and define an\\xa0AI company\\nWe define an Australian AI company as a privately owned or publicly listed company headquartered in Australia whose primary business activities involve making and selling AI products and services to customers. The list of Australian AI companies was constructed using three datasets: Crunchbase (Crunchbase, 2023a), Pitchbook (Pitchbook, 2023) and the Australian AI Ecosystem Discoverability Platform Beta (CSIRO, 2023).\\nOECD search phrases recommended for AI companies, goods and services search: 105\\xa0keywords and phrases\\n544\\nAustralian AI companies\\n531 privately owned organisations13 publicly listed organisationsHeadquartered in AustraliaMaking and selling AI products and servicesValidationCross checking of listsCrunchbase\\nOver 2 million companies’ data including over\\xa081,000 Australian\\xa0companies703\\norganisations discovered\\n831\\norganisations discoveredPitchBook\\nOver 3.6 million companies’ data including over 40,000 companies with\\xa0offices in\\xa0Australia\\nAustralian AI Ecosystem Discoverability Platform\\xa0Beta\\nNAIC directory of Australian capabilities to enable business adoption of AI (126\\xa0companies) and NAIC company list\\xa0(219\\xa0companies)345\\norganisations recorded\\nVerificationManual scan of company websites\\n9We applied a set of 105 AI keywords developed by the OECD (Nakazato and Squicciarini, 2021) to search the descriptions of companies headquartered in Australia. Our aim was to identify companies whose main product or service offering was about AI. We recognise that many (arguably most) companies use AI; but in this analysis, we’re after companies who make and sell AI products or services as their main business activity.As a result of the search through three databases (Crunchbase, Pitchbook, NAIC AI Ecosystem Discoverability Platform Beta and company list), we identified a list of 1,606 Australian companies with unique names. The\\xa0list of companies was further validated and verified by \\ncross -c hecking datasets and manual screening of company \\nweb pages and LinkedIn profiles. Additional companies identified through the stakeholder consultations were also included in the final set, which totalled 544 Australian AI companies, including 531 privately owned companies and 13\\xa0publicly listed companies.To put these findings in perspective, Australia is home to over 360,000 companies operating in the industries where most AI companies operate; namely, professional, scientific and technical services and information media and telecommunications. According to the Australian Bureau of\\xa0Statistics (2023), at the end of June 2023, there were:\\n• 336,214 businesses in Australia in the professional, scientific and technical services industry. The industry demonstrated the third largest net increase in business count in the past year (an increase of 4,960 businesses) after healthcare and social assistance (10,721) and transport, postal and warehousing (5,040)\\n• 24,757 businesses in the information media and telecommunications industry in Australia. Compared with the year before, the number of businesses in the industry dropped by 0.3% or 75 companies.Limitations of our data and\\xa0methods\\nIdentifying AI companies is a challenging task due to the nature of AI as a general-purpose technology and the range of ways it is used across all sectors of the economy. Technology companies also make a large and dynamic marketplace with company entries and exits occurring frequently. The following limitations of this analysis need to\\xa0be considered when interpreting and using the results:\\n• We do not include overseas technology corporations with a presence in Australia because we cannot measure the nature and extent of their Australian (versus\\xa0global) activity. However, they are likely to represent a\\xa0significant share of Australia’s AI activity.\\n• While best efforts were made to collect data on as many Australian AI companies as possible, the list is not exhaustive. The companies with more general descriptions of their activities on Crunchbase and Pitchbook platforms could have been overlooked in\\xa0our\\xa0search.\\n• The coverage of the datasets used (Crunchbase, Pitchbook) has been expanding over time, so trend data\\xa0should be interpreted with caution.\\n• Data availability on the operations of private companies and publicly listed companies varies, so any comparison between these two groups should be performed with\\xa0caution.\\n• The list of AI product and service offerings is sourced from NAIC and complemented by the analysis of Crunchbase industry classifications. This list is not exhaustive and the classification categories are not mutually exclusive.\\n• For industry analysis, we applied the Crunchbase industry taxonomy, which differs from the taxonomy used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.Overall, the number of AI companies is likely to change over time. Companies will grow, merge, enter and exit. Definitions of AI will change as the technology changes. Therefore, our estimate of AI companies in this report is a\\xa0snapshot for the time of publication.\\n10 Australia’s artificial intelligence ecosystemProduct and service offerings\\nWorking closely with the NAIC, we identified a set of product and service offering categories for Australian AI companies, noting that a company might provide multiple types of offerings. The categories are as follows:\\nData service\\nData services provide resources and expertise for the utilisation of data to develop and optimise AI capabilities, including datasets, data analysis and management. This\\xa0capability includes providers of DaaS (Data as a Service), and web-delivered services that perform various functions on data, such as data mining, visualisation, image\\xa0and speech recognition and others.\\nBusiness transformation\\nThe business transformation AI capability includes technology solutions and services in digitalisation, digital transformation and broader business integration.

Finished solutions providers also offer AI services to companies to help solve business challenges, including end-to-end design, implementation and maintenance of AI\\xa0technologies for specific business use cases.Roughly every two out of five AI companies are engaged in consulting and over 200 companies provide capabilities in skills and training. Skills and training providers enable individuals and organisations to learn and upskill for new workforce capabilities in AI-related domains. Another\\xa0leading share of AI capabilities is in the domain of AI governance and ethics (19%), which includes companies actively promoting diversity and inclusion in the industry.To understand the capabilities of the Australian AI ecosystem, we applied the NAIC taxonomy of AI product and service offering categories to the company descriptions. We incorporated the results of the NAIC survey (CSIRO, 2023) and the Crunchbase industry group classifications (Crunchbase, 2023b) to better define what capabilities each company contributes to the Australian AI ecosystem. Each Australian AI company was classified into at least one of the ten AI product and service offering\\xa0categories.Of the 544 Australian AI companies identified in this analysis, 395 (73%) provide capabilities in data services. Data services include expertise for the utilisation of data to develop and optimise AI capabilities, including data analysis and management. This component of AI capability includes providers of DaaS, data mining, visualisation and image and speech recognition, among others.\\n/seven.lowProp/three.lowProp/six.lowProp/five.lowProp/four.lowProp/four.lowProp/three.lowProp/nine.lowProp/two.lowProp/nine.lowProp/two.lowProp/three.lowProp/two.lowProp/two.lowProp/one.lowProp/nine.lowProp\\n/one.lowProp/nine.lowProp/one.lowProp/one.lowProp\\n/zero.lowProp/two.lowProp/zero.lowProp/four.lowProp/zero.lowProp/six.lowProp/zero.lowProp\\n/eight.lowProp/zero.lowPropData servicesFinished solutionsConsultingSkills and training Hardware and infrastructureResearch and innovationCloud servicesGovernance and ethicsSystems integrationBusiness transformation\\nSHARE OF AUSTRALIAN AI COMPANIES /parenleft.capN = /five.LP/four.LP/four.LP/parenright.cap /parenleft.cap%/parenright.cap\\nCapabilities each company contributes to the Australian AI ecosystem\\n13AI companies by industry\\xa0grouping\\nWe used industry groupings available in commercial databases to map AI companies by industry group.

We ran an unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithm\\n2 to identify locations in Australia where AI companies are geographically clustered. We found 8 clusters in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide containing 296 companies (54% of the total companies identified). The AI companies are located within proximity to each other, indicating tight clustering, with an average nearest neighbour distance of 80 m (range = 55 m to 158 m).\\n2 The clusters are centred on these locations and were identified by an unsupervised machine learning algorithm called DBSCAN – density-based spatial \\nclustering of applications with noise.

For example, having a larger population and economy, Canada recently reported 670 AI companies (University of Toronto, 2020). Until\\xa0the last decade, the number of AI companies founded annually in Australia was growing at a slow pace, with an average of 5.5 companies added to the ecosystem annually between 1986 and 2013. This growth has since intensified, with 74 companies founded in 2017, 61 in 2018 and 57 in 2019. A\\xa0similar pattern has been observed internationally, including the UK and Singapore.\\nThe United Kingdom and Singapore have shown similar temporal growth patterns to Australia\\nShare of Australian IT and AI companies by founding year\\nNote: The total count of Australian companies with data on the foundation year was 521 for AI companies and 6,772 for IT companies (1993–2023).The Australian AI business ecosystem is young, with 76% of companies (396 companies) founded in the last decade. The emerging nature of Australian AI companies is evident when compared to the broader Australian IT sector: the median company age is 6 years for AI companies and 13\\xa0years for IT companies. The Australian IT sector has been growing steadily, with growth intensifying in the last decade. Growth in AI companies is skewed more sharply towards the last 5 years, with 39.2% of Australian AI companies founded in 2018–2022, compared with 14.8% of Australian IT companies (Crunchbase, 2023a).\\n/zero.lowProp/one.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp/two.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp/three.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp/four.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp/five.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp/six.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp\\n/one.lowProp/nine.lowProp/six.lowProp/two.lowProp /two.lowProp/zero.lowProp/two.lowProp/three.lowPropNUMBER OF AUSTRALIAN AI COMPANIES\\n/zero.lowProp/five.lowProp/zero.lowProp/one.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp/one.lowProp/five.lowProp/zero.lowProp/two.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp/two.lowProp/five.lowProp/zero.lowProp/three.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp\\n/one.lowProp/nine.lowProp/eight.lowProp/five.lowProp /two.lowProp/zero.lowProp/two.lowProp/three.lowPropCOUNT OF NEW AI COMPANIES\\nUK Singapore Australia\\n/zero.lowProp/two.lowProp/four.lowProp/six.lowProp/eight.lowProp/one.lowProp/zero.lowProp/one.lowProp/two.lowProp/one.lowProp/four.lowProp/one.lowProp/six.lowProp\\n/one.lowProp/nine.lowProp/nine.lowProp/three.lowProp /one.lowProp/nine.lowProp/nine.lowProp/five.lowProp/one.lowProp/nine.lowProp/nine.lowProp/seven.lowProp /one.lowProp/nine.lowProp/nine.lowProp/nine.lowProp/two.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp/one.lowProp /two.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp/three.lowProp /two.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp/five.lowProp /two.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp/seven.lowProp /two.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp/nine.lowProp /two.lowProp/zero.lowProp/one.lowProp/one.lowProp /two.lowProp/zero.lowProp/one.lowProp/three.lowProp /two.lowProp/zero.lowProp/one.lowProp/five.lowProp /two.lowProp/zero.lowProp/one.lowProp/seven.lowProp /two.lowProp/zero.lowProp/one.lowProp/nine.lowProp /two.lowProp/zero.lowProp/two.lowProp/one.lowProp\\n/two.lowProp/zero.lowProp/two.lowProp/three.lowPropSHARE OF AUSTRALIAN COMPANIES IN EACH SECTOR /parenleft.cap%/parenright.cap\\nIT companies AI companiesThe cumulative number of Australia AI companies has intensified \\nin the last decade\\nNote: Foundation year data was only available for 531 of the total 544\\xa0Australian AI companies identified in this analysis.\\n22\\n Australia’s artificial intelligence ecosystemPublicly listed Australian AI\\xa0companies\\nOur analysis revealed 13 Australian publicly listed AI companies trading on the Australian Stock Exchange and internationally (UK, USA).

In 2022, private investment in AI globally was $132.3 billion (US$91.9 billion) – 18 times higher than it was in 2013 (Maslej et al., 2023). This growth dropped off for the first time in 2022, with global private investment in AI, declining by 26.7% from 2022 to 2021 (Maslej et al., 2023). Conversely, private investment in AI in Australia spiked in 2021 and remained high in 2022. Australia was ranked in 11th place for global ranking by private investment in AI in 2022, which reflected an improvement from 14th place over the period 2013–21.Venture capital (VC) investors in\\xa0Australian AI companies\\nAccording to funding deals recorded on Crunchbase, the top five investors in Australian AI companies are as follows:Flying Fox Ventures is a Victoria-based venture capital investment firm founded in 2021.

We use these datasets to identify AI-related scholarly publishing (peer-reviewed books, book chapters, journal papers and conference papers) using a bibliometric analysis approach.

In this hypothetical case we would probably infer that the country has specialised AI capability in research field X. RTAs are similar to location quotients in economic geography where values above 1.2 to 1.5 are often considered evidence of significant specialisation (Crawley\\xa0et\\xa0al. 2013).In our analysis, we apply a statistical technique developed by Crawley et al. (2013) to identify ranges above and below the estimated RTA score. Originally developed for use in the calculation of location quotients in economic geography, this statistical technique handles cases where a small number of publications might yield a high score but also carries high uncertainty and is therefore not significant.\\nRTA=\\nNumber of AI papers in field_x in countryNumber of papers in field_x in country\\nNumber of AI papers in field_x in worldNumber of papers in field_x in world\\nRTA=1201000\\n30,0001,000,000\\nRTA=12%3%RTA=4.0We adopt the revealed technology advantage (RTA) metric to assess the level of specialisation Australia has in application domains of AI. The RTA is a metric proposed by the OECD (2023) to measure technological specialisation and assess the comparative advantages a country or a jurisdiction might have in a particular technology. Countries/jurisdictions will typically seek to invest in technological capabilities where they have a comparative advantage (i.e., those denoted by a high RTA).An illustration of how the RTA is calculated is given below for a hypothetical example where a country has 120 AI papers in research field X and 1,000 papers in research field X in total. This compares to the world which has 30,000 AI papers in research field X and 1,000,000 papers in research field X in total. This would yield a high RTA score of 4. The\\xa0calculations are as follows:\\n28 Australia’s artificial intelligence ecosystemSince 2000, Australian researchers have published 92,940\\xa0peer-reviewed journal articles, conference papers, books and book chapters that refer to AI technologies in the title, abstract or keywords. This\\xa0represents 5.5% of our total publishing. The\\xa0intensity of AI publishing has increased over time, with AI publishing accounting for 9.6% of all publishing today\\xa0compared with 2.5% in 2000.Knowledge creation (research\\xa0publishing trends)\\nCompared to other countries Australian researchers have higher AI adoption rates, with 9.6% of Australian research publications using or developing AI technology versus a global average of 7.2%. Since 2000, Australia created 2.2% of AI-related global publications, compared with 1.5% of global research publications on all topics, demonstrating Australia’s above-average contribution to global AI research. While Australia’s publications grew in absolute terms from 2021 to 2022, Australia’s share of global publications declined due to a rapid increase in global publishing driven by other countries, such as China.\\nShare of all peer-reviewed publishing on the topic of AI\\nThe volume of AI research publications with an Australian author has been growing, except for the pandemic when there was a downturn in publishing in most fields\\nNote: According to The Lens, overall publishing in all fields saw a slowdown during 2021–22 associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Patent applications are costly and time-consuming, so they have to be worth the effort. Analysing AI patents provides insights into the creation of cutting-edge commercially valuable inventions in Australia.However, we note that patents only capture part of what’s happening. Research has shown that 36% of product innovations result in patent applications (Arundel and Kabla, 1998). So, whilst patent analyses provide some insight into AI and product innovation, they likely do not capture the bulk of activity, nor is there an alternative comprehensive and consistent measure of product\\xa0innovation.Product innovation and patent\\xa0applications\\nWith these caveats in mind, patents can still provide insights into AI product innovation trends. In this section, we analyse patent data relating to AI for Australia. The\\xa0headline graph on the number of AI patents by Australian jurisdiction, applicant and inventor shows the bulk of Australian AI patents had an overseas applicant or inventor. All three trends show growth patterns, with more rapid growth since 2016.The share of global AI patent applicants and inventors in Australia has fallen over time. This trend is likely to be largely driven by increases in global patenting activity, rather than a decline in patenting activity in Australia. However, the number of global AI patent applications in the Australian jurisdiction has grown sharply since 2010, which is likely to be associated with the increasing presence of overseas technology companies based in Australia.\\nThere has been a sharp increase in the share of global AI patent applications submitted in the Australian jurisdiction\\nNote: The last data point is for 2023 and is based on data only from January to June 2023.\\nAI patent applications in Australia/zero.lowProp/two.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp/four.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp/six.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp/eight.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp/one.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp\\n/two.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp /two.lowProp/zero.lowProp/two.lowProp/two.lowPropNUMBER OF PATENT APPLICATIONS\\nAI patent applications lodgedin the Australian jurisdiction\\nAI patent applications where\\nthe applicant resides in AustraliaAI patent applications whereinventor resides in Australia/zero.lowProp./zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp./one.lowProp/zero.lowProp./two.lowProp/zero.lowProp./three.lowProp/zero.lowProp./four.lowProp/zero.lowProp./five.lowProp/zero.lowProp./six.lowProp/zero.lowProp./seven.lowProp/zero.lowProp./eight.lowProp\\n/two.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp/zero.lowProp /two.lowProp/zero.lowProp/two.lowProp/three.lowPropPERCENT OF GLOBAL AI PATENT APPLICATIONSMADE WITHIN AUSTRALIA /parenleft.cap%/parenright.cap \\nBy jurisdiction By applicant By inventor\\n38 Australia’s artificial intelligence ecosystemThere were 379 AI patent applications in the Australian jurisdiction in 2022 (the last full year of data in The Lens), compared with 73 submitted by Australian applicants and 119 by Australian inventors.

This last data point captures only January to June 2023; whether it’s an aberration or longer term trend is unclear. This share of global AI patents is on par with the share of global patents covering all topics that have an Australian inventor. Australia’s share of global patents (on all topics) has been on the decline due to the rapid growth of patent production, especially from emerging economies such as China.Australia’s contribution to global AI patent applications remains well below our contribution to AI research publishing. From January to June 2023, Australia contributed 1.6% of the world’s peer-reviewed AI research publishing but only 0.24% of global AI patent applications (with an Australian inventor). This discrepancy suggests that we are not converting AI research into AI product innovations and commercialisation opportunities at the same rate as other countries.

These engagements sought to better understand current and emerging areas of competitive advantage across the Australian AI ecosystem, the unique value proposition of Australian-developed AI and opportunities to grow and support the ecosystem in the future. This section details the key themes emerging from these consultations and their implications for future directions across the AI ecosystem in Australia.\\nThe hype versus the reality around\\xa0AI\\nInterest in AI technologies has been accelerated by the release of tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Bard and Microsoft’s Bing and there is a sense that we are still in the beginning stages of the current AI hype cycle. These developments have made it easier for business leaders to visualise the potential benefits that AI technology could provide for their organisations and Australian AI service providers are routinely using ChatGPT as a useful reference point in discussing AI opportunities with clients.Despite this interest, there is a reasonable degree of apprehension across government and businesses about adopting and experimenting with AI technologies, with some organisations more risk-averse than others. Moreover, even if a business is open to implementing AI technologies, many are held back due to fragmented data systems and/or the investment needed to resolve these data issues. Further work is needed to educate decision-makers about the types of problems that AI can address or are best suited to and the level of investment and development required to reach an optimal solution.\\nThe perceived value of local AI service providers\\nWhen it comes to deciding whether to outsource AI capabilities to an Australian or international provider, there are several considerations. A key factor is access to capabilities, with many companies opting for an international AI service provider if the appropriate capabilities do not exist or cannot be identified locally. The NAIC has established the Australian AI Ecosystem Discoverability Platform, a directory of Australian capabilities that support the adoption of AI technologies and a useful starting point in connecting local AI service providers with businesses (CSIRO, 2023). There could be future opportunities to expand the platform’s coverage of the Australian AI ecosystem and awareness of the platform.There are natural proximity advantages to doing business with Australian AI service providers. These include operating in the same time zone, having access to face-to-face support and an appreciation for the local industry context. There is also an innate trust associated with Australian-developed AI technologies (see An Opportunity for safe and responsible AI). On the other hand, there is a tendency to assume that AI models that have been developed by larger international companies are more reliable or scalable by virtue of being developed in bigger markets or with greater resources. This perception, along with existing business relationships with international suppliers, can sway Australian companies to do business with an international AI service provider.Deciding on what AI to build, buy\\xa0or borrow\\nWill Australia be a leading creator of AI technologies or adopt technologies developed elsewhere? There is a general perception across the AI ecosystem that Australian businesses will likely be a consumer of internationally developed AI technologies. Despite being the 13th most advanced economy, Australia is currently ranked as the 82nd most complex economy (Observatory of Economic Complexity, 2023) and has low rates of adoption of AI and data analytics relative to other OECD countries (Productivity Commission, 2022). To be globally competitive, Australia needs to set the conditions that support AI adoption as well as create unique AI capabilities.Australia has a strong network of universities and research institutes working on AI technologies, but there is a persisting challenge in commercialising and scaling innovations. There are likely to be cases where it is advantageous to outsource or adapt existing AI technologies when there are cost and capabilities barriers to developing from scratch. But there could be areas where there is an imperative to develop sovereign foundational AI models and technologies (e.g., applications based on data resources that cannot be used to train international models due to privacy restrictions). Some stakeholders were supportive of using open-source models as a starting point for building these foundational AI capabilities.\\n43Australia’s modest culture and low appetite for risk were also highlighted as factors that are holding the AI ecosystem back from developing novel AI technologies. This was exemplified in expatriates who had returned to Australia after spending a substantial period working in international technology clusters like Silicon Valley. Showcasing AI success stories of innovative AI technologies and applications across the Australian AI ecosystem, such as those featured in this report, could help to create a cultural shift around opportunities for the Australian AI ecosystem to drive future technology developments.\\nPrioritising being an AI specialist over an AI generalist\\nAustralian businesses felt the current national AI approach is too broad and aspirations to position Australia as a global leader in AI technologies could be misplaced. This sentiment is based on the acknowledgement that we do not have the population, market or economy size and level of investment in AI needed to compete with large multinational technology companies. Instead, a more desirable approach could be to focus on building and growing our AI capabilities and reputation in specialised areas where Australia has a strategic and/or comparative advantage. Deciding on areas of AI specialisation could take different forms.For example, there could be opportunities to leverage existing industry strengths in heavy industries, such as mining and agriculture, where there are clear benefits for the role of automation, computer vision and advanced decision support tools. There could also be opportunities to leverage Australia’s rich renewable energy resources to sustainably power AI technologies. Australia’s large, open spaces suitable for testing novel autonomous technologies could also be attractive for international companies looking to develop and test in a smaller market. Finally, in line with the Australian Government’s ambition for Australia to be a global leader in trusted, secure and responsible AI (DISR, 2023a), stakeholders acknowledged the unique advantage of Australia in developing trusted AI technologies (see An Opportunity for safe and responsible AI).An opportunity for safe and responsible AI\\nEnsuring safe and responsible AI practices is important for Australian businesses to mitigate potential risks associated with AI, including legal and reputational risks (Reid et al., 2023). It is acknowledged across the Australian AI ecosystem that there is a significant opportunity for Australia to be a global leader in the development and use of safe and responsible AI technologies. This ambition aligns with the Australian Government’s latest consultation on safe and responsible AI in Australia which aims to identify the optimal regulatory and policy approach to ensure AI developed and used in Australia is done so in a safe and responsible manner (DISR, 2023b).Australia is not alone in its desire to be a global leader in safe and responsible AI. Other countries, including Singapore, the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union, are among a suite of jurisdictions that are exploring both voluntary and regulatory approaches safeguarding future AI developments and applications (DISR, 2023b). Stakeholders across the Australian AI ecosystem emphasised the need for a balanced, risk-based approach to regulating AI to ensure such policies do not unnecessarily slow or disrupt future AI uptake and developments.The ‘Australian brand’ is a trusted asset, which puts the nation in a strong position to drive future safe and responsible AI developments. There is a current disconnect, however, between best practice approaches to responsible AI and actual business practices: the 2023 Responsible AI Index found that82% of Australian organisations believed they were practising AI responsibly but only 24% had measures in place to ensure this was the case (Fifth Quadrant, 2022). To support Australian businesses in implementing AI safely and responsibly, the NAIC and the Gradient Institute have released a guide on implementing the Australian Government’s eight AI ethics principles (Reid et al., 2023).\\n44 Australia’s artificial intelligence ecosystemFinding our strength through our\\xa0diversity\\nWith every 3 in 10 people living in Australia born overseas, Australia is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse countries in the world (AIHW, 2023). This provides a unique comparative advantage when it comes to developing novel AI technologies: AI models that are trained on representative Australian data are likely to be less vulnerable to population biases and be fit for purpose as an exportable AI product or service in other countries. This data diversity could be particularly powerful when developing AI health applications or designing technologies to mitigate biases against marginalised populations.Conversely, a lack of diversity in training data used in developing international AI technologies can be a challenge for Australian businesses looking to apply these technologies locally given they might not perform well in an Australian context. There is an opportunity for the Australian AI ecosystem to leverage this diversity in the creation of novel AI technologies, as well as position itself as the testbed for international companies looking to improve the quality and representativeness of the training data their models are built upon.\\nStrengthening linkages across the AI ecosystem\\nAcross the AI ecosystem in Australia, there is a perceived lack of strong leadership and connectivity. In some cases, this can lead to duplicated efforts across academia and industry, with parallel streams of AI development on similar technologies. In other cases, Australian businesses can struggle to identify the right AI capabilities they need and resort to sourcing these capabilities internationally. While these barriers likely reflect the nascent nature of Australia’s emerging AI sector, it nonetheless requires attention to maximise opportunities for Australia to define and strengthen its global reputation in AI and mature as an\\xa0ecosystem.Some stakeholders pointed to opportunities to leverage various national and state-based AI hubs and networks across Australia as a mechanism for improving connectivity across the ecosystem. Example AI hubs across Australia include the NAIC (and its Responsible AI Network), the Queensland AI Hub, and the university and research institutions listed in this report (see Universities and research institutes).Partner programs offered by large technology companies, such as Amazon Web Services Partner Programs and Google’s Cloud Partner Advantage Program, were also acknowledged as a useful channel for increasing the reach of Australian AI service providers, particularly startups and smaller providers.Growing Australia’s AI talent and business ecosystem\\nTalent shortages are a persisting struggle reported by Australian businesses, particularly when it comes to sourcing specialised technical skills. While it can be challenging for Australian businesses to offer globally competitive salary packages, the liveability benefits of Australia can be attractive for skilled workers looking to stay in Australia or relocate here. Beyond these lifestyle perks, the stakeholders consulted in this project suggested other potential mechanisms for growing Australia’s AI talent pipeline and attracting and retaining AI companies in\\xa0Australia.For instance, countries such as Singapore have introduced several top-down measures designed to grow their AI sector as part of their national AI strategy, including streamlining its process for patenting AI technologies, boosting research and development investment into AI and fostering an attractive AI startup ecosystem (Goode et al., 2023). Australian expatriate technology workers can also face challenges returning home to work remotely for an international technology company, with stakeholders acknowledging the need to reduce the friction in this process. Australia could also consider new approaches for injecting talent into the AI ecosystem, such as hybrid academic-industry positions, which could also help to improve connectivity across sectors.\\n4546 Australia’s artificial intelligence ecosystemThe following case studies provide examples of Australian companies \\nat the coal-face of developing AI solutions for industry.\\nStreamlining the management of critical infrastructureAustralia’s AI ecosystem case\\xa0studies\\nThere are thousands of kilometres of wastewater pipelines beneath us that need to be regularly inspected for maintenance or repair issues. Traditionally, engineers would inspect the condition of these pipes manually using CCTV footage, which is extremely challenging and costly for utilities, councils and organisations. Sydney-based VAPAR uses AI to eliminate the repetitive and manual requirements of infrastructure management (VAPAR, \\n2023). Its cloud -b ased platform uses machine learning to \\nautomatically assess the condition of pipes and identify defects from CCTV footage.The VAPAR platform improves the accuracy and timeliness of pipe condition assessments, generates cost savings and strengthens the consistency across assessments. VAPAR processes over 200,000 metres of wastewater infrastructure across Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. This case study highlights Australia’s ability to develop AI solutions that solve tangible problems improving the safety and efficiency of critical infrastructure.\\nImage source: VAPAR.Solutions\\n47Helping clinicians detect conditions better and faster\\nIn partnership with I-MED, harrison.ai launched annalise.ai in 2020, a decision-support solution for chest X-rays. The first product, Annalise CXR, provides decision support for radiologists to detect conditions quickly and accurately from chest X-rays (CXR). This solution outperforms similar CXR systems and can detect more clinical findings (124) than the next most comprehensive CXR product (75). \\nA peer -r eviewed study of Annalise CXR also found a \\nsignificant improvement in radiologist reporting, with the AI model matching a radiologist’s decision in 86.5% of cases (Jones et al., 2021). franklin.ai, a joint venture between Sonic Healthcare and harrison.ai, aims to similarly augment and improve pathologists’ decision-making using AI. \\nSydney-based harrison.ai uses AI to address the healthcare \\nsystem’s wicked problem – the need to provide quality, equitable and timely care in the face of growing workforce shortages (Harrison AI, 2023). Already caring for over one million patients a year in Australia, their goal is to raise the standard of healthcare for one million patients a day by 2025 and make equitable healthcare a reality for all. harrison.ai is developing technologies that combine the strengths of human intelligence and AI and equip clinicians with decision-support tools that can improve their capacity and quality of care.Image source: harrison.ai\\n48\\n Australia’s artificial intelligence ecosystemMelbourne-based Sapia.ai has developed an AI-enabled recruitment tool that aims to make hiring more inclusive, efficient and effective (Sapia, 2023). Sapia.ai uses proprietary algorithms and data to automate elements of the hiring process, reducing time-to-hire for large organisations, interrupting bias in hiring and enhancing the\\xa0candidate experience.One of Sapia.ai’s key tenets is that the end-to-end system, including the algorithms, must be fair and explainable. Their platform was built to minimise bias in the hiring process and excludes the use of video data, data scraped from the web, metadata or any other third-party data. The\\xa0algorithms only use data provided by the candidate with consent. They have also developed and published a FAIR AI for Recruitment (FAIR) framework, which presents a set of guidelines for fair, transparent and trustworthy applications of AI in recruitment.The platform has been used to interview more than 3\\xa0million people in 47 countries, including candidates from industries such as retail, insurance, financial services, healthcare and aviation. Sapia’s national and international success provides an exemplar of the value of fair, trusted and responsible AI technologies and lays the groundwork for future opportunities to position Australia as a leader in\\xa0this domain.Taking a human ‑fi rst approach to AI in recruitment\\nImage source: Sapia.ai\\n49Australia’s renowned mining sector is poised to harness the potential of technological advancements, with AI playing a central role. In 2018 an Australian technology company and Solve Geosolutions, an Australian data science consultancy, came together to create Datarock (DiUS, 2023). They saw an opportunity to leverage AI technology and provide the industry with a solution that transforms core imagery into actionable data and delivers reliable insights (Datarock,\\xa02023; DiUS, 2023).Traditionally, drill core is logged by manual inspection by \\na geologist or geotechnical engineers, a labour -i ntensive \\napproach susceptible to inconsistencies and errors. Datarock technology – which utilises deep learning models and computer vision – enables core imagery to be processed via a cloud-hosted platform, automating drill core analysis and extracting geoscientific insights that are consistent, auditable, and can surpass the quality and\\xa0quantity of traditional human-based observations.The platform eliminates mundane human effort, empowering the user to focus on data interpretation and making informed, data-rich decisions that add additional value to mining operations. Datarock has been embraced by many of the world’s largest mining companies across the\\xa0globe.Mining data for new mineral opportunities\\nImage source: DiUS and Datarock\\n50\\n Australia’s artificial intelligence ecosystemConnecting remote communities with essential supplies and services\\nSwoop Aero has developed the world’s first end -t o -e nd \\ndrone logistics platform that is working to bridge the tyranny of distance across Australia and beyond (Swoop\\xa0Aero, 2023). Using digital twins, sensor technologies, machine learning and computer vision, Swoop Aero’s drones are plugged into an integrated logistics network to seamlessly deliver products of up to 5\\xa0kg, including medical supplies, with a range of 130\\xa0km at speeds of 200 km/h. This technology has also been used to map and respond to disaster-prone areas, patrol coastal environments for incidents and monitor wildlife and\\xa0flora\\xa0for conservation\\xa0purposes.In 2018, Swoop Aero was awarded the world’s first commercial contract to provide medical drone logistics services in Vanuatu. Healthcare workers previously transported vaccinations in iceboxes and would have to navigate difficult terrain to deliver these medical supplies. Swoop Aero successfully piloted an integrated drone network for delivering vaccines and other medical supplies to remote locations across Vanuatu and has since operated over 70 flights and delivered more than 25 kg of medical supplies. Similar successful healthcare projects have been conducted in Malawi, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Mozambique, providing timely access to medical supplies for communities living in remote locations.\\n51Australia’s R&D sector has higher (and growing) rates of AI adoption compared to global\\xa0averages\\nAustralia has higher intensity of AI research than the global average. In Australia, 9.6% of all R&D publications in 2022 referred to AI technologies compared to 7.2% globally. The rate of research publications has also been increasing. In 2023, AI R&D publishing by public and private sector organisations accounted for 9.6% of all R&D publishing which is up from 9.4% the year before, 4.9% in 2015 and 2.5% in the year 2000. Since 2000, the Australian R&D sector has published 92,940 peer-reviewed books, book chapters, conference papers and journal papers about AI.Australia’s AI companies are young, vibrant and nimble\\nThree-quarters of Australia’s AI companies have been operating for less than 10 years. This is comparatively younger than both economy-wide companies and IT sector companies. For example, around 40% of Australian AI companies were founded in 2018–22 compared to roughly 15% of Australian IT companies. Our AI companies are also small, often employing 50 staff or less. However,\\xa0the\\xa0youth and size of Australian AI companies could be an advantage, enabling companies to pivot quickly to changing market conditions and respond to early-stage AI\\xa0technology\\xa0developments.Key takeaways\\nAustralia’s AI companies have grown rapidly in the last five years\\nUntil the last decade, the number of AI companies founded annually in Australia was growing at a slow pace. An\\xa0average of 5.5 companies were added to the ecosystem per year between 1986 and 2013. The last decade saw intensified growth in the number of newly registered Australian AI companies, with a spike of 74 companies founded in 2017 followed by 61 and 57 over 2018–19. We\\xa0now have 544 AI companies, which is on par with other global AI leaders. For example, with a larger population and economy, Canada recently reported 670 AI companies (University of Toronto, 2020).Geographic hotspots and clusters are forming – AI companies like to be near other AI companies\\nWe examined spatial clustering patterns of AI companies in Australian cities and found that they are tightly clustered. We identified eight clusters in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, with more forming in other cities and regions. We found that 54% of AI companies were in one of the clusters and that the average distance from an AI company to its nearest neighbour AI company was 80\\xa0m. This suggests we are likely to see the emergence \\nof\\xa0place -b ased AI hubs in Australia in the future.1 3 \\n2 4 \\n52 Australia’s artificial intelligence ecosystemAustralia has a mature AI ecosystem with clear specialisations in AI technology and\\xa0applications\\xa0domains\\nStakeholders across Australia’s AI ecosystem identified a desire to focus on specialised areas for AI development, rather than positioning Australia as a “jack of all” AI capabilities. Our analysis highlighted current areas of AI specialisation when it comes to specific AI technologies (e.g. self-organising maps, ant colony optimisation, gradient tree boosting) and application domains (e.g. optometry, livestock production and decision sciences). Beyond these R&D-driven strengths, stakeholders also highlighted opportunities for Australia to take a world-leading role in areas complementary to existing industry and geographical strengths, or AI technologies that emphasise Australia’s trusted brand.Australia creates much AI knowledge but relatively few commercial products\\nWe found that Australia contributes 1.6% of global \\npeer -r eviewed research publishing on AI. By comparison, \\nwe found that Australia contributes only 0.2% of global AI patent applications where the inventor resides within Australia. This shows that we are not converting our knowledge and understanding of cutting-edge AI science into commercial products at the same rate as other countries. Essentially, we give the world more knowledge about AI than commercial AI products. This sentiment was echoed in consultations with stakeholders across the\\xa0Australian AI ecosystem.Australia is recognised as a place for trusted and responsible AI\\xa0innovation\\nThe Australian brand is a key asset that can be leveraged when it comes to the development of safe and responsible AI. In addition to focusing on specialised areas of strategic advantage, stakeholders from the AI ecosystem identified the strength of Australia’s reputation as a comparatively trustworthy and appropriately regulated country. This\\xa0global positioning, combined with Australia’s diverse population which is beneficial when developing AI technologies that are generalisable to diverse markets, could be used to position Australia as a global leader in the development and use of safe and responsible AI\\xa0technologies.\\n6 5 7 \\n53Planned improvements\\nFuture AI ecosystem reports\\nThis is the second AI ecosystem report released by CSIRO’s National Artificial Intelligence Centre. It captures a broader range of source data compared to last year’s report. And\\xa0there are plans to expand and improve the metrics captured and communicated in future reports. In this section we explore some of the main planned improvements for future versions.\\n1. Improved data on the AI workforce (workers and skills demand profile)\\nWe know that most of Australia’s AI workforce is not in one of the AI companies we identified. They’re in banks, mining companies, software companies, supermarkets and a wide range of other companies that are developing AI capabilities to achieve improved business processes. At the current time, there is no formal classification of an AI worker in the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations (ANZSCO). This means we can’t get statistics from formal government sources (e.g.\\xa0The Australian Bureau of Statistics) on the number of, and types of, AI workers in Australia. However, it may be possible to use alternative online data about AI jobs (e.g.\\xa0job adverts). By meshing ANZSCO data from the census with online data, we could build a more detailed picture of\\xa0Australia’s AI workforce.2. Improved data on AI training and\\xa0education providers\\nAustralia’s schools, universities and technical colleges provide extensive education and training on AI-related topics. These include skills and knowledge areas such as machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, mathematics, statistics, software engineering, computer coding and data science. It\\xa0also covers skills and knowledge such as AI business strategy, technology foresight, government policy and planning, ethics, user experience/design, human-computer interfaces and organisational transformation. The AI training ecosystem is likely to be expanding and diversifying in Australia to meet the demand for these skills and knowledge. Future versions of this report could examine the size and structure of Australia’s AI training and education sector.\\n3. Analysis of AI adoption patterns and\\xa0productivity impacts\\nThere is an increasing body of evidence about productivity uplift associated with AI adoption. For example, a recent study by Stanford University (Brynjolfsson et al., 2023) found that customer support staff were able to solve 14% more complex customer questions per hour when they used generative AI chatbots. It was also found to increase customer satisfaction and the productivity gains were more than double for new and inexperienced staff. However, not all AI adoption stories are about success. There is much complexity and challenge about how AI is adopted, which tools are used and how they are applied (Hajkowicz and Whittle, 2023). Future versions of the AI Ecosystem report could explore the extent of adoption, patterns of adoption and productivity impacts.\\n54 Australia’s artificial intelligence ecosystemReferences\\nArundel A, Kabla I (1998) What percentage of innovations are patented? empirical estimates for European firms.

Its \\nadvice to governments, businesses and families is informed by ASD’s other roles, which include gathering \\nforeign intelligence and conducting offensive cyber operations in support of the Australian military.\\nAs part of our work, we sometimes discover security weaknesses or vulnerabilities in technology that are \\nunknown to the vendor and may pose a threat to Australians and Australian systems.\\nFor many years, we have made these vulnerabilities known to vendors so they can patch or otherwise mitigate \\nthe threat to their systems and customers.\\nOur starting position is simple: when we find a weakness, we disclose it.\\nOccasionally, however, a security weakness will present a novel opportunity to obtain foreign intelligence \\nthat will help protect Australians. In these circumstances, the national interest might be better served by not \\ndisclosing the vulnerability.\\nThe decision to retain a vulnerability is never taken lightly. It is only made after careful multi-stage expert \\nanalysis, and is subject to rigorous review and oversight.\\nOur decision-making framework is based on a single objective: ensuring the safety and security of Australia \\nand Australians.\\nThe process is guided by eight essential principles:\\n1. Security first.  ASD’s default position is to release information on vulnerabilities when we become \\naware of them. Protecting Australians is our top priority.\\n2. The national interest.  We only retain a vulnerability if the national interest in keeping it strongly \\noutweighs the national interest in disclosing it. This might happen if the weakness allows us to gather \\nforeign intelligence that will prevent a terrorist attack, for example.\\n3. Assess the risk. ASD carefully considers the likelihood of a malicious actor being able to take \\nadvantage of the weakness. If we assess it is likely a malicious actor will discover and exploit the \\nvulnerability, we will disclose the vulnerability so it can be fixed.\\n4. Consider the consequences.  ASD carefully considers the potential impact if the weakness is exploited \\nby a malicious actor. Considerations would include who and what could be affected, and how much \\ndamage could be done.\\n5. Mitigate the threat. If a vulnerability is retained, ASD will do all we can to protect Australian systems \\nfrom being exploited. For instance, we might release security advice that mitigates the weakness.\\n6. Responsible release.  ASD works closely with vendors to ensure that patches and other mitigation \\nmeasures are available before information on a vulnerability is made public.\\n7. Regular review.  ASD reviews all vulnerability retention decisions on an on-going basis. We do not ‘set \\nand forget’. If the national security imperatives are no longer pressing, we will release the vulnerability.\\n8. Rigorous oversight.  All of ASD’s vulnerability decisions are subject to independent review by the \\nInspector-General of Intelligence and Security. ASD submits an annual report covering all vulnerability \\ndecisions to the Inspector-General. A copy of this report is also provided to the Minister for Defence.\\nASD acts lawfully and ethically. We operate within the letter and the spirit of the law. Australians can be  \\nassured that each and every decision about a cyber security vulnerability is made meticulously and in  \\nthe national interest.  \\nCOUNTRY PROFILE : Australia  \\n \\n1. Introduction (Geograph y and Climate )  \\nThe population  of Australia is about 25  million people with 85% of these living within 50 km of the \\ncoasts. Population density ranges from above 10,000 people per square km to less than 0.2 \\npersons per square km in the arid centre.  \\nHuman habitation of the Australian continent is estimated to ha ve begun around 65,000 to 70,000 \\nyears ago, with the migration of people by land bridges and short sea -crossings from what is now \\nSoutheast Asia. These first inhabitants were the ancestors of modern Indigenous Australians. \\nAboriginal Australian culture is one of the oldest continual civilizations on earth.  Subsequent to \\nEuropean settlement (which commenced in the late 18th century) and immigration from many \\ndiverse regions the population has steadily increased, particularly over the last 60 years.  \\n1.1 Land  and Climate  \\nAustralia comprises a land area of about 7. 7 million square kilometres. Although this is just five \\nper cent of the world's land mass,  Australia is the planet's sixth largest country after Russia, \\nCanada, China, the United States of America and Brazil. It is also the only one of the largest six \\nnations that is completely surrounded by water.  \\nAustralia's land mass is:  \\n▪ almost as great as t hat of the United States of America  \\n  \\nINTERNATIONAL COMMISSION ON IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE  \\n  \\n2 \\n ▪ about 50 per cent greater than Europe, and  \\n▪ 32 times greater than the United Kingdom   \\nAustralia is the smallest of the world's continents. It is also the lowest, the flattest and (apart from \\nAntarctica) the driest. The highest point on the Australian mainland is Mount Kosciuszko, at 2228 \\nmetres above sea level. The lowest point is the dry bed of Lake Ey re, South Australia, which is 15 \\nmetres below sea level.  \\nAustralia  is surrounded by many thousands of islands . Nearly 40 per cent of the total coastline length \\ncomprises island coastlines.  \\nNearly 20 per cent of Australia's land mass is classified as desert . As well as having a low average \\nannual rainfall, rainfall across Australia is also variable. The rainfall pattern is concentric around the \\nextensive arid core of the continent, with rainfall intensity high in the tropics and some coastal \\nareas.  \\n1.2 Climate  \\nClimatic zones range from tropical rainforests, deserts and cool temperature forests to snow \\ncovered mountains. Within this climate, our plants and animals have evolved on a geographically \\nisolated continent, through a time of a slowly drying climate, comb ined with continuing high \\nvariability.  \\nAustralia is the driest inhabited continent in the world; rainfall is extremely variable,  and droughts are \\ncommon. The community has become more aware of this because of the extended dry conditions \\nexperienced across  much of the country during the millennium drought. With these pressures on the \\nenvironment and economy, the Intergovernmental Agreement for a National Water Initiative (NWI) \\nwas signed by the Australian Government and all state and territory governments t o better manage \\nAustralia’s scarce and valuable water resources.  \\nAustralia is a relatively arid continent, with 80 per cent of the land receiving less than 600 millimetres \\nof rainfall per year, and half receiving less than 300 millimetres of rainfall per year. Development \\nacross Australia has been heavily dependent on access to water resources that are far more variable \\nin volume and quality than in other parts of the world.  \\nOn average, only 12% (less than 3% in the drier areas and up to 24% in the wetter areas) of rainfall \\nenters the rivers; the remaining rainfall is accounted for by evaporation, used by vegetation or stored \\nin lakes, wetlands and groundwater aquifers. Almost 50% of Australia’s average annual run -off enters \\nthe Gulf of Carpentaria, a regio n of relatively limited water resource development, and the Timor Sea.  \\n2. Rivers and Agriculture   \\n2.1 Rivers  \\nRivers are one of the most important natural features of the Australian environment. There are many \\ndifferent types of rivers in Australia, their char acter, dependent ecosystems, and unique flora and \\nfauna determined by climate and geomorphology. Rivers in northern Australia are influenced by \\nmonsoonal rains; the arid interior receives sporadic, heavy rainfall from tropical cyclones, resulting in \\nspecta cular flooding, while the southern parts of Australia receive more uniform rainfall in a \\ntemperate climate.  \\nRivers sustain billabongs, large floodplains, and lakes and estuaries, the nurseries of bountiful \\nfisheries. Rivers are the home of red gum and cool abah  trees. The spiritual role of rivers in Dreamtime \\nstories of Aboriginal peoples is also very important. Rivers were the pathways for European explorers 3 \\n and subsequent colonists, and our largest rivers became important corridors of trade. Few Australian  \\ntowns are far from a river, with many of them on a floodplain.  \\nMany of Australia’s distinctive and important rivers are severely  degraded . Australian rivers are under \\nincreasing pressure from over -extraction, pollution, catchment modification and river regulation. All \\nrivers within regions with intensive agriculture are degraded to some degree by human activity.  \\n2.2 The Murray Darling Basin  \\nThe Murray -Darling Basin (MDB) is well known as Australia’s ‘‘food bowl ’’ but it is much more than \\nthat, as it s agricultural output makes a major contribution to the national economy. Agriculture is \\nthe dominant economic activity in the MDB accounting for about 39% of the nation’s gross value of \\nagricultural production in 2005 -2006 (Australian Bureau of Statistics  [ABS], 2008). On an area basis, \\nin 2005 –06, the MDB contained 65% of Australia’s total area of irrigated crops and pastures. \\nImportant irrigation industries are dairy, cotton, rice and horticulture (in particular viticulture). The \\nMDB has been the initiat or of many experiments in irrigation reforms capping water extractions and  \\nwater trading  entitlements . \\n2.3 Agricultur e (areas sown, types of crops etc.)  \\nAgricultural businesses operate across about  half of Australia's total land area. 87% o f the land \\nfarm ed is  used for grazing and 31 million hectares are cropp ed. \\nThe gross value of Australian agriculture was $60.8 billion in 2016 -17 with crops accounting for $32 \\nbillion. The dominant crops, by weight , were  sugarcane, wheat, barley, oats and canola.  \\nAustral ia irrigates 2 million hectares of land for cotton, rice, fruit crops, grapevines, pastures and \\nvegetables.  The annual farm gate value of produce from irrigation farms is about $12.0 billion \\nAustralian, or more than 25% of the total agricultural productio n of the nation.  \\nThe ma in irrigation area is the Murray -Darling Basin ( covering parts of South Australia, New South \\nWales, Queensland and Victoria).  Water required for irrigation is stored in reservoirs in the upper \\nreaches of the main streams and rivers and is released to downstream irrigators  and environmental \\npurposes .   \\n3. Water Management in Australia  \\n3.1  Water resources (Availability – surface water & ground water, Present use)  \\nTotal consumptive use of water in 2016 -17 was 16,287 gigalitres. Of this amount, 10,233 gigalitres \\nwas consumed by the agriculture; 1,483 gigalitres was consumed by the water supply services \\nindustry; a further 2,662 gigalitres by all other industries; and 1,909 gigalitres by households. \\nAustralia’s average water consumption is 432 litres per capita per day.  \\n  4 \\n 3.2 Development of Storages (Multi -purpose, Single purpose for irrigation)  \\nhttp://www.bom.gov.au/water/a bout/publications/document/factsheet_waterstorage.pdf  \\nAustralia has  over 500 large dams providing water for domestic, irrigation and industrial use. Many \\nof these dams have a multiple supply function with larger catchments with irrigation use often \\nhaving multiple dams in the upper catchments. Many of the irrigation farms of the central and \\nnorthern Murray Darling basin have on-farm storages which capacity greater than 1 gigalitre.  \\nAs with other industries, the 1980s saw a change in focus for water management. No longer was the \\nfocus on bigger dams to solve water issues, but rather, consistent with other microeconomic reforms \\nof the time, options were being examined to improve the al location of existing entitlements. The \\nobjective behind this was to promote efficiency and equity in water allocation while protecting the \\nenvironment.   \\n4. Irrigation  \\n4.1 Development of  irrigation (Irrigation development overview , Ultimate irrigation potent ial, \\nFlow irrigation, Types of irrigation systems, Drainage of irrigation schemes, Pressurized irrigation/ \\nmicro irrigation (Sprinkler irrigation, Drip irrigation ), Ground water irrigation including conjunctive \\nuse of ground & surface water for irrigation , Lift irrigation from rivers, lakes etc., statistics on these .  \\nThe formative years of irrigation in Australia were in the 19th Century and the major irrigation \\ndevelopments occurred initially in the Murray -Darling Basin, where the conditions were the mos t \\nconducive to such development. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a dramatic increase in \\nirrigation development both in the Murray Darling Basin and elsewhere, as predominantly state \\ngovernments attempted to overcome a natural water scarcity  \\nIn New South Wales, 500,000 ha of pastures, and 200,000 ha of rice and cotton are flood irrigated.  \\nExtensive earth and concrete lined channel supply systems divert waters from storages and \\nwaterways to irrigation districts.  Many of these systems have been in  use for 50 -80 years.  \\nIn Victoria, 500,000 ha of pastures are flood irrigated. Major channel systems divert water from the \\nriver systems to the irrigation districts.  \\nIn South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales, over 100,000 ha of high value horticultu ral crops \\n(citrus, grapes, stonefruit, almonds, vegetables) are sprinkler or drip irrigated. In horticultural \\nirrigation districts water is often distributed in low pressure pipelines, which have often replaced the \\nolder channel systems.  South Australia a lso irrigated 60,000 ha of pastures.  \\nIn other states, a similar range of crops are produced.  Queensland also irrigates 140,000 ha of \\nsugarcane.  Many inland areas of Australia have been developed only through the irrigation industry.  \\n4.2 Irrigation Manage ment  \\nAccess to irrigation water is controlled by the government with the amount available to any irrigator, \\nor the area that may be irrigated, regulated. Significant private irrigators do exist,  but most regional \\nwater supply infrastructure is owned, const ructed, maintained and operated by government \\nagencies.   \\nBefore the 1970s, property rights to irrigation water resided largely with state governments. Since \\nthe 1970s, there has been a transfer of property rights from state governments to either individua l \\nirrigators or to collectives of irrigators that have taken over ownership and management of the \\ndistribution infrastructure. In the MDB, the Murray -Darling Basin Authority (formerly the Murray -\\nDarling Basin Commission restructured in 2008) is the supreme  body to address land, water and 5 \\n environmental management issues across the basin. Currently, various legal and corporate forms of \\nirrigation management entities are operating in the MDB.  \\nWater governance in Australia is now operating under the COAG water reform framework, it \\nrequires the development of a comprehensive system of water allocations (including water sharing \\nplans) and entitlements. These reforms were commenced in 1994 and enha nced in 1995 when NSW, \\nVictoria, South Australia and Queensland agreed to implement a cap on diversions as part of the \\nMurray -Darling Basin Agreement, based on 1993 -94 levels of utilisation.  \\nIn 2003, COAG agreed to refresh its 1994 water reform agenda by developing a new National \\nWater Initiative. Among other things, the Initiative set out reforms for best practice pricing and \\ninstitutional arrangements. This included:  \\n▪ promoting the economically efficient and sustainable use of water;   \\n▪ giving effect to t he principles of user -pays;  \\n▪ achieving pricing transparency; and  \\n▪ facilitating the efficient functioning of water markets.  \\n \\nThe Australian Government recognised the returning of irrigation diversions to sustainable levels \\nwould be facilitated by a funding stream that would also minimise impacts on regional and rural \\ncommunities. The Sustainable Rural Water Use and Infrastructure Program (SRWUIP) was \\nestablished as a national program which invests in rural water use, management and efficiency, \\nincluding impr oved knowledge and market reform. Water savings arising from SRWUIP investment Box 1 Overview of Australia’s national water reform and key events  \\n1863: Inter -colonial conference discusses management of the River Murray  \\n1887: South Australian Royal Commission examines the effects of irrigation on river navigation in the \\nRiver Murray  \\n1914 –1917: New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia sign the River Murray Waters Agreement \\nand establish the River Murray Commission  \\n1970: River Murray Commission publishes detailed study of irrigation and salinity  \\n1981: River Murray mouth closes temp orarily  \\n1987: Murray –Darling Basin Agreement signed  \\n1989: River Murray Salinity and Drainage Strategy agreed  \\n1992 –1996: Commencement of corporatisation and price regulation in urban water  \\n1994: COAG agrees to Water Reform Framework and National Competition  Policy  \\n1995: Initial cap on water diversion from the River Murray  \\n1997: Millennium Drought commences (persists until 2009)  \\n2004: National Water Initiative  \\n2007 –2008: Water Act 2007  (Cwlth) passed and Murray –Darling Basin Authority created as a result of \\nthe National Plan for Water Security  \\n2008 –2009: Further water reform agreements by COAG  \\n2012: Murray –Darling Basin Plan takes effect  \\n2013: COAG agrees next steps in water reform.  \\n2017: Review of the Murray Darling Basin Plan commences  \\n2017: Productivity Commission Review into National Water Reform progress  \\nSources : Australian Water Partnership (2016), COAG (2008), MDBA (2013, 2017) and PIRSA (2013), \\nSCEW (2013), PC (2017).  6 \\n in infrastructure efficiencies are shared between the irrigators/irrigation water providers and the \\nCommonwealth (for environmental use).   \\n4.3 Moderni sation of irrigation systems  \\nIrriga tion technology continues to evolve both at the system and farm level and to keep up to date \\nsignificant investment by governments (principally via Sustainable Rural Water Use and \\nInfrastructure Program - SRWUIP) has seen dramatic improvements in water use  efficiency in \\nsystems by reducing conveyance losses (operational, seepage and evaporation) and on -farm by \\nadoption of ‘state of the art’ micro, spray and surface irrigation systems.  \\nIrrigation infrastructure operators have often seen system efficiencies improve by more than 15% \\nwith some realising much higher efficiency gains (more than 30%). While many lower cost system \\nefficiency options have been implemented by system operators, it  is the cooperative approach \\nbetween governments and system operators, involving millions of dollars, which has reaped the \\nbenefits to operators, farmers and the environment.  \\nThe more extensive irrigation infrastructure operators have made use of SRWUIP f unding to \\nmodernise their irrigation infrastructure. Under this modernisation, old manually operated \\nstructures have been replaced with automated gates, leaky channels have been replaced by lined \\nchannels and pipelines and old -style Dethridge outlets have been replaced with modern accurate \\nfarm outlets. Many of these automated systems are so controlled that farmers are able to order \\nwater and see it being delivered to their farm offtake via computer.  \\nWater savings from efficiency gains from these modernisat ions have been reallocated to the \\nenvironment to reduce diversions to sustainable levels.  \\n \\n5. Irrigation Issues  \\n5.1 Salinity & waterlogging in irrigation areas  \\nThe Basin Salinity Management Strategy (BSMS) is a response to the significant threat that salinity \\nposes to the Murray -Darling Basin. The strategy’s objectives help communities and governments \\nwork together to control salinity and protect water quality, environmental values, regional \\ninfrastructure and productive agricultural land. In 2001, the  Basin Salinity Management Strategy \\n(2001 –2015) replaced the Salinity and Drainage Strategy, the first coordinated salinity management \\ninitiative established in 1988. The BSMS reached the halfway point in 2007.  \\n \\n5.2 Farmer participation & irrigation manag ement transfer (IMT)  \\nAustralia adopted IMT and have followed this approach in its economically important river basins \\nincluding the Murray -Darling Basin (MDB). While some smaller government irrigation  schemes were \\ntransferred to WUAs as early as the mid -1980s major schemes did not start this transfer to the early \\n7 \\n 1990s. In the Murray Darling Basin, major irrigation infrastructure is now operated/managed by \\nWUAs through various types of ownership, these include private companies, cooperatives, trusts \\nand st ate-owned corporations.  \\nThe transfer process was assisted/facilitated by the government, farmers, industry organizations and \\nirrigation agencies. Momentum for further devolution of powers to water users was provided by the \\nWater Reform Framework (1994) whi ch required that constituents in the irrigation sector be given a \\ngreater degree of responsibility in irrigation management.  \\nIMT has now successfully been implemented in Australia. In some instances, governments paid for \\nor contributed to the upgrading of infrastructure (both on farm and off -farm) prior to transfer.  \\n5.3 Water Quality Issues  \\nThe Australian Water Resources Assessment 2000 (NLWRA, 2001) identified major nutrient (mainly \\nnitrogen and phosphorous) exceedances in nearly two -thirds of assessed ba sins.  \\n \\nSalinity, the saltiness of the water, was a major water quality issue for 32% assessed basins in the \\nNLWRA 2001. High levels of salinity occur in catchments where a large proportion of land has been \\ncleared. Increased salinity in ground and surface  water will worsen the irrigation salinity problem \\nthat many farmers already face.  \\nTurbidity was a major water quality issue in 61% of assessed basins.  \\nMany issues affect the water resources and ecosystems of the MDB including salinity , erosion , blue -\\ngreen algal blooms , water quality, and invasive species. Climate change  and resultant possible \\nincreases in drough t pose a significant risk to the availability of surface water in the MDB.  \\nOver the years, the combination of natural droughts and increasing human use of the waterways for \\nagriculture, manufacturing and communities has led to a decline in the health of th e Basin.  \\n5.4 Future Issues  \\nAs at June 2019 Australia was seven years into the 12-year  Murray Darling Basin Plan.  With more \\nthan 77,000km of rivers the environmental reform plan is perhaps the world’s most ambitious river \\nreform agenda. With an average annual flow of around 33,000GL, the Plan aims to transfer up to \\n3,200 GL of previously c ommercially available water to the environment.  Already around 20% of \\nwater previously available for irrigation has been returned to the environment.  The reform covers \\nthe entire catchment and is designed to achieve healthy rivers, healthy communities an d a \\ncontinuing capacity to produce food and fibre.   \\nWater recovery has been via direct purchase of water entitlements by Government, along with \\nfunding for on and off farm efficiency, where half the water saving is given back to the Government \\nand half re tained for maintaining or increasing production.  The Commonwealth Environmental \\nWater Holder now holds more than 2,800GL of water entitlements, which assessments show are \\nalready producing positive environmental outcomes.  \\nOver the coming years the reform  challenge includes putting in place ‘supply’ projects that will \\ndeliver water to environmental assets with reduced loss, thus allowing improved environmental \\noutcomes without removing productive water.  The plan also has $1.7 billion allocated to fund \\nfurther projects which improve water use efficiency and return additional water to the environment.   \\nClimate Change and ongoing drought pose real challenges with long term inflow scenarios changing \\nas warming produces more frequent drought, lower overall rai nfall but with more frequent heavy \\nrainfall events.  The Basin Plan is designed to adjust to climate variation, with irrigation allocations 8 \\n varying substantially, but changes to long term inflows will have impacts on production and the \\nenvironment.  \\n \\n------------------------   XXXXXXXX  ------------------------  \""
